       "'1\\n Financial Contracts\\n My friend Jerry lives in a small town, the same town in which he was born and\\n raised. Because Jerry’s parents are no longer alive and many of his friends have\\n left, he is seriously thinking of packing up and moving to a larger city. However,\\n Jerry recently heard that there is a plan to build a major highway that will pass\\n very close to his hometown. Because the highway is likely to bring new life to\\n the town, Jerry is reconsidering his decision to move away. It has also occurred\\n to Jerry that the highway may bring new business opportunities.\\n For many years, Jerry’s family was in the restaurant business, and Jerry\\n is thinking of building a restaurant at the main intersection leading from the\\n highway into town. If Jerry does decide to build the restaurant, he will need to\\n acquire land along the highway. Fortunately, Jerry has located a plot of land,\\n currently owned by Farmer Smith, that is ideally suited for the restaurant. Because\\n the land does not seem to be in use, Jerry is hoping that Farmer Smith might\\n be willing to sell it.\\n If Farmer Smith is indeed willing to sell, how can Jerry acquire the land\\n on which to build his restaurant? First, Jerry must find out how much Farmer\\n Smith wants for the land. Let’s say $100,000. If Jerry thinks that the price is\\n reasonable, he can agree to pay this amount and, in return, take ownership of\\n the land. In this case, Jerry and Farmer Smith will have entered into a spot or\\n cash transaction.\\n In a cash transaction, both parties agree on terms, followed immediately\\n by an exchange of money for goods. The trading of stock on an exchange is\\n usually considered to be a cash transaction: the buyer and seller agree on the\\n price, the buyer pays the seller, and the seller delivers the stock. The actions\\n essentially take place simultaneously. (Admittedly, on most stock exchanges,\\n there is a settlement period between the time the price is agreed on and the\\n time the stock is actually delivered and payment is made. However, the settlement period is relatively short, so for practical purposes most traders consider\\n this a cash transaction.)\\n However, it has also occurred to Jerry that it will probably take several\\n years to build the highway. Because Jerry wants the opening of his restaurant\\n \\n 1\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 1\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cto coincide with the opening of the highway, he doesn’t need to begin construction on the restaurant for at least another year. There is no point in taking possession of the land right now—it will just sit unused for a year. Given\\n his construction schedule, Jerry has decided to approach Farmer Smith with\\n a slightly different proposition. Jerry will agree to Farmer Smith’s price of\\n $100,000, but he will propose to Farmer Smith that they complete the transaction in one year, at which time Farmer Smith will receive payment, and Jerry\\n will take possession of the land. If both parties agree to this, Jerry and Farmer\\n Smith will have entered into a forward contract. In a forward contract, the parties\\n agree on the terms now, but the actual exchange of money for goods does not\\n take place until some later date, the maturity or expiration date.\\n If Jerry and Farmer Smith enter into a forward contract, it’s unlikely that\\n the price Farmer Smith will want for his land in one year will be the same price\\n that he is asking today. Because both the payment and the transfer of goods are\\n deferred, there may be advantages or disadvantages to one party or the other.\\n Farmer Smith may point out that if he receives full payment of $100,000 right\\n now, he can deposit the money in his bank and begin to earn interest. In a forward contract, however, he will have to forego any interest earnings. As a result,\\n Farmer Smith may insist that he and Jerry negotiate a one-year forward price that\\n takes into consideration this loss of interest.\\n Forward contracts are common when a potential buyer requires goods in\\n the future or when a potential seller knows that a supply of goods will be ready\\n for sale in the future. A bakery may need a periodic supply of grain to support\\n operations. Some grain may be required now, but the bakery also knows that\\n additional grain will be required at regular intervals in the future. In order to\\n eliminate the risk of rising grain prices, the bakery can buy grain in the forward\\n market—agreeing on a price now but not taking delivery or making payment\\n until some later date. In the same way, a farmer who knows that he will have\\n grain ready for harvest at a later date can sell his crop in the forward market to\\n insure against falling prices.\\n When a forward contract is traded on an organized exchange, it is usually\\n referred to as a futures contract. On a futures exchange, the contract specifications\\n for a forward contract are standardized to more easily facilitate trading. The\\n exchange specifies the quantity and quality of goods to be delivered, the date\\n and place of delivery, and the method of payment. Additionally, the exchange\\n guarantees the integrity of the contract. Should either the buyer or the seller\\n default, the exchange assumes the responsibility of fulfilling the terms of the\\n forward contract.\\n The earliest futures exchanges enabled producers and users of physical\\n commodities—grains, precious metals, and energy products—to protect themselves against price fluctuations. More recently, many exchanges have introduced futures contracts on financial instruments—stocks and stock indexes,\\n interest-rate contracts, and foreign currencies. Although there is still significant\\n trading in physical commodities, the total value of exchange-traded financial\\n instruments now greatly exceeds the value of physical commodities.\\n Returning to Jerry, he finds that he has a new problem. The government\\n has indicated its desire to build the highway, but the necessary funds have not\\n 2\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 2\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cyet been authorized. With many other public works projects competing for a\\n limited amount of money, it’s possible that the entire highway project could be\\n canceled. If this happens, Jerry intends to return to his original plan and move\\n away. In order to make an informed decision, Jerry needs time to see what the\\n government will do. If the highway is actually built, Jerry wants to purchase\\n Farmer Smith’s land. If the highway isn’t built, Jerry wants to be able to walk\\n away without any obligation.\\n Jerry believes that he will know for certain within a year whether the highway project will be approved. As a result, Jerry approaches Farmer Smith with\\n a new proposition. Jerry and Farmer Smith will negotiate a one-year forward\\n price for the land, but Jerry will have one year to decide whether to go ahead\\n with the purchase. One year from now, Jerry can either buy the land at the\\n agreed-on forward price, or he can walk away with no obligation or penalty.\\n There is much that can happen over one year, and without some inducement Farmer Smith is unlikely to agree to this proposal. Someone may make\\n a better offer for the land, but Farmer Smith will be unable to accept the offer\\n because he must hold the land in the event that Jerry decides to buy. For the\\n next year, Farmer Smith will be a hostage to Jerry’s final decision.\\n Jerry understands Farmer Smith’s dilemma, so he offers to negotiate a\\n separate payment to compensate Farmer Smith for this uncertainty. In effect,\\n Jerry is offering to buy the right to decide at a later date whether to purchase\\n the land. Regardless of Jerry’s final decision, Farmer Smith will get to keep\\n this separate payment. If Jerry and Farmer Smith can agree on this separate\\n payment, as well as the forward price, they will enter into an option contract. An\\n option contract gives one party the right to make a decision at a later date. In\\n this example, Jerry is the buyer of a call option, giving him the right to decide\\n at a later date whether to buy. Farmer Smith is the seller of the call option.\\n Deciding whether to buy the land for his restaurant is not Jerry’s only problem. He owns a house that he inherited from his parents and that he was planning to sell prior to moving away. Before hearing about the highway project,\\n Jerry had put up a “For Sale” sign in front of the house, and a young couple,\\n seeing the sign, showed enough interest in the house to make an offer. Jerry was\\n seriously considering accepting the offer, but then the highway project came\\n up. Now Jerry doesn’t know what to do. If the government goes ahead with the\\n highway and Jerry goes ahead with his restaurant, he wants to keep his house.\\n If not, he wants to sell the house. Given the situation, Jerry might make a proposal to the couple similar to that which he made to Farmer Smith. Jerry and\\n the couple will agree on a price for the house, but Jerry will have one year in\\n which to decide whether to actually sell the house.\\n Like Farmer Smith, the couple’s initial reaction is likely to be negative.\\n If they agree to Jerry’s proposal, they will have to make temporary housing\\n arrangements for the next year. If they find another house they like better, they\\n won’t be able to buy it because they might eventually be required to purchase\\n Jerry’s house. They will spend the next year in housing limbo, a hostage to Jerry’s\\n final decision.\\n As with Farmer Smith, Jerry understands the couple’s dilemma and offers\\n to compensate them for their inconvenience by paying an agreed-on amount.\\n F inancial C ontract s\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 3\\n \\n 3\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cRegardless of Jerry’s final decision, the couple will get to keep this amount. If\\n Jerry and the couple can agree on terms, Jerry will have purchased a put option\\n from the couple. A put option gives one party the right to decide whether to sell\\n at a later date.\\n Perhaps the most familiar type of option contract is insurance. In many\\n ways an insurance contract is analogous to a put option. A homeowner who\\n purchases insurance has the right to sell all or part of the home back to the\\n insurance company at a later date. If the home should burn to the ground, the\\n homeowner will inform the insurance company that he now wishes to sell the\\n home back to the insurance company for the insured amount. Even though the\\n home no longer exists, the insurance company is paying the homeowner as if\\n it were actually purchasing the home. Of course, if the house does not burn\\n down, perhaps even appreciating in value, the homeowner is under no obligation to sell the property to the insurance company.\\n As with an insurance contract, the purchase of an option involves the payment of a premium. This amount is negotiated between the buyer and the seller,\\n and the seller keeps the premium regardless of any subsequent decision on the\\n part of the buyer.\\n Many terms of an insurance contract are similar to the terms of an option\\n contract. An option, like an insurance contract, has an expiration date. Does a\\n homeowner want a six-month insurance policy? A one-year policy? The insurance contract may also specify an exercise price, how much the holder will receive\\n if certain events occur. This exercise price, which may also include a deductible amount, is analogous to an agreed-on forward price.\\n The logic used to price option contracts is also similar to the logic used\\n to price insurance contracts. What is the probability that a house will burn\\n down? What is the probability that someone will have an automobile accident? What is the probability that someone will die? By assigning probabilities to different occurrences, an insurance company will try to determine a\\n fair value for the insurance contract. The insurance company hopes to generate a profit by selling the contract to the customer at a price greater than its\\n fair value. In the same way, someone dealing with exchange-traded contracts\\n may also ask, “What is the probability that this contract will go up in value?\\n What is the probability that this contract will go down in value?” By assigning probabilities to different outcomes, it may be possible to determine the\\n contract’s fair value.\\n In later chapters we will take a closer look at how forwards, futures, and\\n options are priced. For now, we can see that their values are likely to depend\\n on or be derived from the value of some underlying asset. When my friend Jerry\\n wanted to enter into a one-year forward contract to buy the land from Farmer\\n Smith, the value of the forward contract derived from (among other things)\\n the current value of the land. When Jerry was considering buying a call option\\n from Farmer Smith, the value of that option derived from the value of the forward contract. When Jerry was considering selling his house, the value of the\\n put option derived from the current value of the house. For this reason, forwards, futures, and options are commonly referred to as derivative contracts or, simply, derivatives.\\n 4\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 4\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cThere is one other common type of derivatives contract. A swap is an\\n agreement to exchange cash flows. The most common type, a plain-vanilla\\n interest-rate swap, is an agreement to exchange fixed interest-rate payments for\\n floating interest-rate payments. But a swap can consist of almost any type of\\n cash-flow agreement between two parties. Because swaps are not standardized\\n and therefore most often traded off exchanges, in this text we will restrict our\\n discussion to the most common derivatives—forwards, futures, and options.\\n \\n Buying and Selling\\n We usually assume that in order to sell something, we must first own it. For most\\n transactions, the normal order is to buy first and sell later. However, in derivative markets, the order can be reversed. Instead of buying first and selling later,\\n we can sell first and buy later. The profit that results from a purchase and sale is\\n usually independent of the order in which the transactions occur. We will show\\n a profit if we either buy first at a low price and sell later at a high price or sell\\n first at a high price and buy later at a low price.\\n Sometimes we may want to specify the order in which trades take place. The\\n first trade to take place, either buying or selling, is an opening trade, resulting in an open\\n position. A subsequent trade, reversing the initial trade, is a closing trade. A widely used\\n measure of trading activity in exchange-traded derivative contracts is the amount\\n of open interest, the number of contracts traded on an exchange that have not yet\\n been closed out. Logically, the number of long and short contracts that have not\\n been closed out must be equal because for every buyer there must be a seller.\\n If a trader first buys a contract (an opening trade), he is long the contract.\\n If the trader first sells a contract (also an opening trade), he is short the contract. Long and short tend to describe a position once it has been taken, but\\n traders also refer to the act of making an opening trade as either going long\\n (buying) or going short (selling).\\n Buy first\\n \\n Open long position\\n \\n Opening trade\\n \\n Sell first\\n \\n Sell later\\n \\n Closing trade\\n \\n Open short position\\n \\n Buy later\\n \\n A long position will usually result in a debit (we must pay money when we\\n buy), and a short position will usually result in a credit (we expect to receive\\n money when we sell). We will see later that these terms are also used when trading multiple contracts, simultaneously buying some contracts and selling others.\\n When the total trade results in a debit, it is a long position; when it results in a\\n credit, it is a short position.\\n F inancial C ontract s\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 5\\n \\n 5\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cThe terms long and short may also refer to whether a trader wants the market to rise or fall. A trader who has a long stock market position wants the stock\\n market to rise. A trader who has a short position wants the market to fall. However, when referring to derivatives, the terms can be confusing because a trader\\n who has bought, or is long, a derivative may in fact want the underlying market\\n to fall in price. In order to avoid confusion, we will refer to either a long or short\\n contract position (we have either bought or sold contracts) or a long or short\\n market position (we want the underlying market to rise or fall).\\n \\n Notional Value of a Forward Contract\\n Because a forward contract is an agreement to exchange money for goods at\\n some later date, when a forward contract is initially traded, no money changes\\n hands. Because no cash flow results, in a sense, there is no cash value associated with the contract. But a forward contract does have a notional value or nominal value. For physical commodities, the notional value of a forward contract is\\n equal to the number of units to be delivered at maturity multiplied by the unit\\n price. If a forward contract calls for the delivery of 1,000 units at a price of $75\\n per unit, the notional value of the contract is $75 × 1,000 = $75,000.\\n For some forward contracts, physical delivery is not practical. For example,\\n many exchanges trade futures contracts on stock indexes. But it would be\\n impractical to actually deliver a stock index because it would require the delivery of all stocks in the index in exactly the right proportion, which in some cases\\n might mean delivering fractional shares. For financial futures, where the contract is not settled through physical delivery, the notional value is equal to the\\n cash price of the index or instrument multiplied by a point value. A stock index\\n that is trading at 825.00 and that has a point value of $200 has a notional value\\n of 825.00 × $200 = $165,000.\\n The point value of a stock index or similar contract is set by the exchange\\n so that the contract has a notional value that is deemed reasonable for trading.\\n If the point value is set too high, trading in the contract may be too risky for\\n most market participants. If the point value is set too low, transaction costs may\\n be prohibitive because it may require trading a large number of contracts to\\n achieve the desired result.\\n \\n Settlement Procedures\\n What actually happens when a contract is traded on an exchange? The settlement procedure—the manner in which the transfer of money and ownership\\n of a contract is facilitated—depends on the rules of the exchange and the type\\n of contract traded.\\n Consider a trader who buys 100 shares of a $50 stock on an exchange. The\\n total value of the stock is 100 × $50 = $5,000, and the buyer is required to pay the\\n seller this amount. The exchange, acting as intermediary, collects $5,000 from the\\n buyer and transfers this money to the seller. At the same time, the exchange takes\\n 6\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 6\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cdelivery of the shares from the seller and transfers these to the buyer. This is essentially a cash transaction with the exchange making both delivery and payment.\\n Suppose that the stock that was originally purchased at $50 per share subsequently rises to $60. How will the buyer feel? He will certainly be happy and\\n may mentally record a profit of $1,000 (100 shares times the $10 increase per\\n share). But he can’t actually spend this $1,000 because the profit is unrealized —it\\n only appears on paper (hence the term paper profit). If the buyer wants to spend the\\n $1,000, he will have to turn it into a realized profit by going back into the marketplace and selling his 100 shares to someone else at $60 per share. This stock-type\\n settlement requires full and immediate payment, and all profits or losses are unrealized until the position is closed.\\n Now consider what happens when a futures contract is traded on an exchange.\\n Because a futures contract is a forward contract, there is no immediate exchange\\n of money for goods. The buyer pays no money, and the seller receives none. But\\n by entering into a forward contract, both the buyer and the seller have taken on\\n future obligations. At contract maturity, the seller is obligated to deliver, and the\\n buyer is obligated to pay. The exchange wants to ensure that both parties live up\\n to these obligations. To do this, the exchange collects a margin deposit from each\\n party that it holds as security against possible default by the buyer or seller. The\\n amount of margin is commensurate with the risk to the exchange and depends\\n on the notional value of the contract, as well as the possibility of price fluctuations\\n over the life of the futures contract. An exchange will try to set margin requirements high enough so that the exchange is reasonably protected against default\\n but not so high that it inhibits trading.\\n For example, consider the futures contract calling for delivery of 1,000 units\\n of a commodity at a unit price of $75. The notional value of the contract is\\n $75,000. If the exchange has set a margin requirement for the contract at $3,000,\\n when the contract is traded, both the buyer and seller must immediately deposit\\n $3,000 with the exchange.\\n What happens if the price of the commodity subsequently rises to $80?\\n Now the buyer has a profit of $5 × 1,000 = $5,000, whereas the seller has a loss\\n of equal amount. As a result, the exchange will now transfer $5,000 from the\\n seller’s account to the buyer’s account. This daily variation credit or debit results\\n from fluctuations in the price of the futures contract as long as the position remains open. Futures-type settlement, where there is an initial margin deposit followed by daily cash transfers, is also known as margin and variation settlement.\\n A futures trader can close out a position in one of two ways. Prior to maturity of the futures contract, he can make an offsetting trade, selling out the futures contract he initially bought or buying back the futures contract he initially\\n sold. If the position is closed through an offsetting purchase or sale, a final variation payment is made, and the margin deposit is returned to the trader.\\n Alternatively, a trader may choose to carry the position to maturity, at which\\n time physical settlement will take place. The seller must make delivery, and the\\n buyer must pay an amount equal to the current value of the commodity. After\\n delivery and payment have been made, the margin deposits will be returned to the\\n respective parties. In our example, the original trade price was $75. If the price\\n of the commodity at maturity is $90, the buyer must pay $90 × 1,000 = $90,000.\\n F inancial C ontract s\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 7\\n \\n 7\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cIt may seem that the buyer has paid $15 more per unit than the original\\n trade price of $75. But recall that as the futures contract rose in price from $75\\n to $90, the buyer was credited with $15 in the form of variation. The total price\\n paid, the $90 final price less the $15 variation, was indeed equal to the agreedon price of $75 per unit.\\n Futures contracts such as stock indexes, which are not settled through physical delivery, can also be carried to maturity. In this case, there is one final variation payment based on the underlying index price at maturity. At that time, the\\n margin deposits are also returned to the parties. These types of futures, where no\\n physical delivery takes place at maturity, are said to be cash-settled.\\n A futures trader must always have sufficient funds to cover the margin requirements for any trade he intends to make. But he should also have sufficient\\n funds to cover any variation requirements. If the position moves against him\\n and he does not have sufficient funds, he may be forced to close the position\\n earlier than intended.\\n There is an important distinction between margin and variation. Margin1 is\\n money collected by the exchange to ensure that a trader can fulfill future financial obligations should the market move against him. Even though deposited with\\n the exchange, margin deposits still belong to the trader and can therefore earn\\n interest for the trader. Variation is a credit or debit that results from fluctuations\\n in the price of a futures contract. A variation payment can either earn interest, if\\n the variation results in a credit, or lose interest, if the variation results in a debit.\\n Examples of the cash flows and profit or loss for a series of stock and futures\\n trades are shown in Figures 1-1 and 1-2, respectively. In each example, we assume\\n that the opening trade was made at the first day’s settlement price so that there is\\n no profit and loss (i.e., a P&L of zero) at the end of day 1. For simplicity, we have\\n also ignored any interest earned on credits or interest paid on debits.\\n We make this very important distinction between stock-type settlement\\n and futures-type settlement because some contracts are settled like stock and\\n some contracts are settled like futures. It should come as no surprise that stock\\n Figure 1-1\\u2002Stock-type settlement.\\n \\n Stock\\n price\\n \\n 1\\n \\n 8\\n \\n Trade\\n \\n Cash flow\\n credit (+)\\n debit (-)\\n \\n Current\\n stock\\n position\\n \\n buy\\n −$53 x 1,200\\n long\\n 1,200 shares = −$63,600 1,200 shares\\n \\n Cumulative\\n realized\\n P&L\\n \\n Unrealized\\n P&L\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 0\\n \\n Day 1\\n (opening trade)\\n \\n $53\\n \\n Day 2\\n \\n $57\\n \\n sell\\n 500 shares\\n \\n +$57 x 500\\n = +$28,500\\n \\n long\\n 700 shares\\n \\n Day 3\\n \\n $51\\n \\n no trade\\n \\n 0\\n \\n long\\n 700 shares\\n \\n +$2,000\\n \\n ($51−$53) x 700\\n = −$1,400\\n \\n Day 4\\n (closing)\\n \\n $54\\n \\n sell\\n 700 shares\\n \\n +$54 x 700\\n = +37,800\\n \\n 0\\n \\n +$2,000 +\\n ($54−$53) x 700\\n = +$2,000 + $700\\n = +$2,700\\n \\n 0\\n \\n ($57−$53) x 500 ($57−$53) x 700\\n = +$2,000\\n = +$2,800\\n \\n A margin requirement for a professional trader on an equity options exchange is sometimes referred to as a haircut.\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 8\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 1-2 Futures-type settlement.\\n contract size: 1,000 units margin, per contract: $3,000\\n Futures\\n price\\n (per unit)\\n \\n Trade\\n \\n Current\\n futures\\n Margin\\n position requirement\\n \\n Variation\\n \\n Cumulative\\n realized\\n P&L\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 0\\n \\n Day 1\\n (opening trade)\\n \\n $75\\n \\n sell\\n short\\n 9 futures 9 futures\\n \\n 9 x $3,000\\n = $27,000\\n \\n Day 2\\n \\n $77\\n \\n no trade\\n \\n short\\n 9 futures\\n \\n 9 x $3,000 ($77−$75) x −9\\n = $27,000\\n x 1,000\\n = −$18,000\\n \\n −$18,000\\n \\n Day 3\\n \\n $74\\n \\n buy\\n short\\n 2 futures 7 futures\\n \\n 7 x $3,000 ($74−$77) x −9\\n = $21,000\\n x 1,000\\n = +$27,000\\n \\n −$18,000\\n +$27,000\\n =+$9,000\\n \\n Day 4\\n \\n $70\\n \\n buy\\n short\\n 4 futures 3 futures\\n \\n 3 x $3,000 ($70−$74) x −7\\n +$9,000\\n = $9,000\\n x 1,000\\n +$28,000\\n = +$28,000 =+$37,000\\n \\n Day 5\\n (closing)\\n \\n $80\\n \\n buy\\n 3 futures\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 0\\n \\n ($80−$70) x −3\\n x 1,000\\n = −$30,000\\n \\n +$37,000\\n −$30,000\\n =+$7,000\\n \\n is subject to stock-type settlement and futures are subject to futures-type settlement. But what about options? Currently, all exchange-traded options in North\\n America, whether options on stock, stock indexes, futures, or foreign currencies,\\n are settled like stock. Options must be paid for immediately and in full, and all\\n profits or losses are unrealized until the position is liquidated. In stock option\\n markets, this is both logical and consistent because both the underlying contract\\n and options on that contract are settled using identical procedures. However, on\\n U.S. futures options markets, the underlying contract is settled one way (futurestype settlement), while the options are settled in a different way (stock-type settlement). This can sometimes cause problems when a trader has bought or sold\\n an option to hedge a futures position. Even if the profits from the option position exactly offset the losses from the futures position, the profits from the option\\n position, because the options are settled like stock, are unrealized. But the losses\\n from the futures position will require an immediate cash outlay to cover variation requirements. If a trader is unaware of the different settlement procedures,\\n he can occasionally find himself with unexpected cash-flow problems.\\n The settlement situation on most exchanges outside North America has\\n been simplified by making option and underlying settlement procedures identical. If the underlying is subject to stock-type settlement, then the options on the\\n underlying are subject to stock-type settlement. If the underlying is subject to\\n futures-type settlement, then the options are subject to futures-type settlement.\\n Under this method, a trader is unlikely to have a surprise variation requirement\\n on a position that he thinks is well hedged.\\n In this text, when presenting option examples, we will generally assume the\\n settlement convention used in North America, where all options are subject to\\n stock-type settlement.\\n F inancial C ontract s\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 9\\n \\n 9\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cMarket Integrity\\n Anyone who enters into a contract to buy or sell wants to be confident that\\n the counterparty will fulfill his responsibilities under the terms of the contract. A\\n buyer wants to be sure that the seller will deliver; a seller wants to be sure that\\n the buyer will pay. No one will want to trade in a marketplace if there is a real\\n possibility that the counterparty might default on a contract. To guarantee the\\n integrity of an exchange-traded contract, exchanges assume the responsibility for both delivery and payment. When a trade is made on an exchange, the\\n link between buyer and seller is immediately broken and replaced with two new\\n links. The exchange becomes the buyer from each seller. If the buyer defaults,\\n the exchange will guarantee payment. The exchange also becomes the seller to\\n each buyer. If the seller defaults, the exchange will guarantee delivery.\\n To protect itself against possible default, an exchange will establish a clearinghouse. The clearinghouse may be a division of the exchange or a completely\\n independent entity and is responsible for processing and guaranteeing all trades\\n made on the exchange.2 The clearinghouse assumes the ultimate responsibility\\n for ensuring the integrity of all exchange-traded contracts.3\\n Figure 1-3 The clearing process.\\n 1.

The seller’s clearing\\n firm reports the trade\\n to the clearinghouse\\n \\n In the United States, the two largest derivatives clearinghouses are the Options Clearing Corporation, responsible for processing all equity option trades, and the CME Clearing House, responsible for processing all trades\\n made on exchanges falling within the CME Group. For instruments other than derivatives, such as stock and\\n bonds, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation provides clearing services for many U.S. exchanges.\\n 3\\n Although the exchange and clearinghouse may be separate entities, for simplicity, we will occasionally use the\\n terms interchangeably.\\n 2\\n \\n 10\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 10\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0cThe clearinghouse is made up of member clearing firms. A clearing firm\\n processes trades made by individual traders and agrees to fulfill any financial\\n obligation arising from those trades. Should an individual trader default, the\\n clearing firm guarantees fulfillment of that trader’s responsibilities. No individual may trade on an exchange without first becoming associated with a\\n clearing firm.\\n As part of its responsibilities, a clearing firm will collect the required margin from individual traders and deposit these funds with the clearinghouse.4 In\\n some cases, the clearinghouse may permit a clearing firm to aggregate the\\n positions of all traders at the firm. Because some traders will have long\\n positions while other traders will have short positions in the same contract, the\\n clearinghouse may reduce the margin deposits required from the clearing firm.\\n At its discretion, and depending on market conditions, a clearing firm may\\n require an individual trader to deposit more money with the clearing firm than\\n is required by the clearinghouse.\\n The current system of guarantees—individual trader, clearing firm, and\\n clearinghouse—has proven effective in ensuring the integrity of exchangetraded contracts. Although individual traders and clearing firms occasionally\\n fail, a clearinghouse has never failed in the United States.\\n \\n We noted earlier that, in theory, there is no loss of interest associated with a margin deposit. In practice, the\\n amount of interest paid on margin deposits will vary by clearing firm and is typically negotiated between the\\n clearing firm and the individual customer.\\n 4\\n \\n F inancial C ontract s\\n \\n 01-Natenberg_ch01.indd 11\\n \\n 11\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:19 PM\\n \\n \\x0c2\\n Forward Pricing\\n What should be the fair price for a forward contract? We can answer this question by considering the costs and benefits of buying now compared with buying on some future date. In a forward contract, the costs and benefits are not\\n eliminated; they are simply deferred. They should therefore be reflected in the\\n forward price.\\n forward price = current cash price + costs of buying now\\n – benefits of buying now\\n Let’s return to our example from Chapter 1 where my friend Jerry wanted\\n to acquire land on which to build a restaurant. He was considering both a cash\\n purchase and a one-year forward contract. If he enters into a forward contract,\\n what should be a fair one-year forward price for the land?\\n If Jerry wants to buy the land right now, he will have to pay Farmer Smith’s\\n asking price of $100,000. However, in researching the feasibility of a one-year\\n forward contract, Jerry has learned the following:\\n 1. The cost of money, whether borrowing or lending,1 is currently 8.00\\n percent annually.\\n 2. The owner of the land must pay $2,000 in real estate taxes; the taxes\\n are due in nine months.\\n 3. There is a small oil well on the land that pumps oil at the rate of $500\\n per month; the oil revenue is receivable at the end of each month.\\n If Jerry decides to buy the land now, what are the costs compared with\\n buying the land one year from now? First, Jerry will have to borrow $100,000\\n from the local bank. At a rate of 8 percent, the one-year interest costs will be\\n 8% × $100,000 = $8,000\\n At this point, we will assume that the same interest rate applies to all transactions, whether borrowing or\\n lending. Admittedly, for a trader, the interest cost of borrowing will almost always be higher than the interest\\n earned when lending.\\n 1\\n \\n 12\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 12\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0cIf Jerry buys the land now, he will also be liable for the $2,000 in property taxes\\n due in nine months. In order to pay the taxes, he will need to borrow an additional\\n $2,000 from the bank for the remaining three months of the forward contract\\n $2,000 + ($2,000 × 8% × 3/12) = $2,000 + $40 = $2,040\\n The total costs of buying now are the interest on the cash price, the real estate\\n taxes, and the interest on the taxes\\n $8,000 + $2,040 = $10,040\\n What are the benefits of buying now? If Jerry buys the land now, at the end\\n of each month he will receive $500 worth of oil revenue. Over the 12-month\\n life of the forward contract, he will receive\\n 12 × $500 = $6,000\\n Additionally, Jerry can earn interest on the oil revenue. At the end of the first\\n month, he will be able to invest $500 for 11 months at 8 percent. At the end of\\n the second month, he will be able to invest $500 for 10 months. The total interest on the oil revenue is\\n ($500 × 8% × 11/12) + ($500 × 8% × 10/12) + … +\\n ($500 × 8% × 1/12) = $220\\n The total benefits of buying now are the oil revenue plus the interest on the oil\\n revenue\\n $6,000 + $220 = $6,220\\n If there are no other considerations, a fair one-year forward price for the\\n land ought to be\\n The current cash price\\n Plus the costs of buying now\\n Less the benefits of buying now\\n \\t\\t\\t\\t\\n \\n $100,000\\n +$ 10,040\\n –$ 6,220\\n $103,820\\n \\n Assuming that Jerry and Farmer Smith agree on all these calculations, it\\n should make no difference to either party whether Jerry purchases the land\\n now at a price of $100,000 or enters into a forward contract to purchase the\\n land one year from now at a price of $103,820. The transactions are essentially\\n the same.\\n Traders in forward or futures contracts sometimes refer to the basis, the difference between the cash price and the forward price. In our example, the basis is\\n $100,000 – $103,820 = –$3,820\\n In most cases, the basis will be a negative number—the costs of buying now will\\n outweigh the benefits of buying now. However, in our example, the basis will\\n turn positive if the price of oil rises enough. If one year’s worth of oil revenue,\\n Forward Pricing\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 13\\n \\n 13\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0ctogether with the interest earned on the revenue, is greater than the $10,040\\n cost of buying now, the forward price will be less than the cash price. Consequently, the basis will be positive.\\n How should we calculate the fair forward price for exchange-traded futures\\n contracts? This depends on the costs and benefits associated with a position in\\n the underlying contract. The costs and benefits for some commonly traded\\n futures are listed in the following table:\\n Instrument\\n \\n Costs of Buying Now\\n \\n Benefits of Buying Now\\n \\n Physical commodity\\n \\n Interest on cash price\\n Storage costs\\n Insurance costs\\n \\n Convenience yield (to be\\n discussed)\\n \\n Stock\\n \\n Interest on stock price\\n \\n Dividends (if any)\\n Interest on dividends\\n \\n Bonds and notes\\n \\n Interest on bond or note price\\n \\n Coupon payments\\n Interest on coupon\\n payments\\n \\n Foreign currency\\n \\n Interest cost of borrowing the\\n domestic currency\\n \\n Interest earned on the\\n foreign currency\\n \\n Physical Commodities (Grains, Energy Products,\\n Precious Metals, etc.)\\n If we buy a physical commodity now, we will have to pay the current price\\n together with the interest on this amount. Additionally, we will have to store the\\n commodity until maturity of the forward contract. When we store the commodity, we would also be wise to insure it against possible loss while in storage. If\\n C = commodity price2\\n t = time to maturity of the forward contract\\n r = interest rate\\n s = annual storage costs per commodity unit\\n i = annual insurance costs per commodity unit3\\n then the forward price F can be written as\\n F = C × (1 + r × t) + (s × t) + (i × t)\\n Initially, it may seem that there are no benefits to buying a physical commodity, so the basis should always be negative. A normal or contango commodity market is one in which long-term futures contracts trade at a premium to short-term\\n contracts. But sometimes the opposite occurs—a futures contract will trade at a\\n discount to cash. If the cash price of a commodity is greater than a futures price,\\n the market is backward or in backwardation. This seems illogical because the interest\\n In this chapter only, we will use a capital C to represent the price of a commodity. In all other chapters, C will\\n refer to the price of a call option.\\n 3\\n For physical commodities, both storage and insurance costs usually are quoted together as one price.\\n 2\\n \\n 14\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 14\\n \\n V O L A T I L I T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0cand storage costs will always be positive. However, consider a company that\\n needs a commodity to keep its factory running. If the company cannot obtain the\\n commodity, it may have to take the very costly step of temporarily closing the factory. The cost of such drastic action may, in the company’s view, be prohibitive.\\n In order to avoid this, the company may be willing to pay an inflated price to obtain the commodity right now. If commodity supplies are tight, the price that the\\n company may have to pay could result in a backward market—the cash price will\\n be greater than the price of a futures contract. The benefit of being able to obtain a commodity right now is sometimes referred to as a convenience yield.\\n It can be difficult to assign an exact value to the convenience yield. However, if interest costs, storage costs, and insurance costs are known, a trader\\n can infer the convenience yield by observing the relationship between the cash\\n price and futures prices. For example, consider a three-month forward contract\\n on a commodity\\n Three-month forward price F = $77.40\\n Interest rate r = 8 percent\\n Annual storage costs s = $3.00\\n Annual insurance costs i = $0.60\\n What should be the cash price C? If\\n F = C × (1 + r × t) + (s × t) + (i × t)\\n then\\n C=\\n \\n F − (s + i ) × t\\n 1+ r × t\\n \\n =\\n \\n 77.40 − (3.00 + 0.60) × 3 /12\\n 1 + 0.08 × 3 /12\\n \\n =\\n \\n 76.50\\n = $75.00\\n 1.02\\n \\n If the cash price in the marketplace is actually $76.25, the convenience yield\\n ought to be $1.25. This is the additional amount users are willing to pay for the\\n benefit of having immediate access to the commodity.\\n \\n Stock\\n If we buy stock now, we will have to pay the current price together with the interest on this amount. In return, we will receive any dividends that the stock\\n pays over the life of the forward contract together with the interest earned on\\n the dividend payments.

The forward price for a stock can\\n then be written as\\n F = [S × (1 + r × t)] – D\\n \\n The forward rate is the rate of interest that is applicable beginning on some future date for a specified period\\n of time. Forward rates are often expressed in months\\n 1 × 5 forward rate A four-month rate beginning in one month\\n 3 × 9 forward rate A six-month rate beginning in three months\\n 4 × 12 forward rate An eight-month rate beginning in four months\\n A forward-rate agreement (FRA) is an agreement to borrow or lend money for a fixed period, beginning on some\\n future date.

Unfortunately, if we begin with the spot exchange rate, add the\\n domestic interest costs, and subtract the foreign-currency benefits, we get an\\n answer that is expressed in different units.

A trader in exchange-traded options on\\n crude oil is really trading options on crude oil futures. A trader in exchangetraded bond options is really trading options on bond futures.\\n For both stock options and futures options, the value of the option will depend\\n on the forward price for the underlying contract. We have already looked at\\n the forward price for a stock. But what is the forward price for a futures contract? A futures contract is a forward contract. Therefore, the forward price for a\\n futures contract is the futures price. If a three-month futures contract is trading\\n at $75.00, the three-month forward price is $75.00. If a six-month futures contract is trading at $80.00, the six-month forward price is $80.00. In some ways,\\n this makes options on futures easier to evaluate than options on stock because\\n no additional calculation is required to determine the forward price.\\n \\n Arbitrage\\n If asked to define the term arbitrage, a trader might describe it as “a trade that\\n results in a riskless profit.” Whether there is such a thing as a riskless profit is\\n open for debate because there is almost always something that can go wrong.\\n For our purposes, we will define arbitrage as the buying and selling of the same\\n or very closely related instruments in different markets to profit from an apparent mispricing.\\n For example, consider a commodity that is trading in London at a price of\\n $700 per unit and trading in New York at a price of $710 per unit. Ignoring\\n transaction costs and any currency risk, there seems to be an arbitrage opportunity by purchasing the commodity in London and simultaneously selling it\\n in New York. Will this yield an arbitrage profit of $10? Or are there other factors that must be considered? One consideration might be transportation costs.\\n The buyer in New York will expect delivery of the commodity. If the commodity is purchased in London, and if it costs more than $10 per unit to ship the\\n commodity from London to New York, any arbitrage profit will be offset by the\\n transportation costs. Even if transportation costs are less than $10, there are\\n also insurance costs because no one will want to risk loss of the commodity in\\n transit, either by air or by sea, from London to New York. Of course, anyone\\n trading a commodity professionally ought to know the transportation and insurance costs. Consequently, it will be immediately obvious whether an arbitrage profit is possible.\\n In a foreign-currency market, a trader may attempt to profit by borrowing a low-interest-rate domestic currency and using this to purchase a\\n Later, in Chapter 22, we will also look at stock index futures and options.\\n The OTC market, or over-the-counter market, is a term usually applied to trading that does not take place on an\\n organized exchange.\\n 5\\n 6\\n \\n Forward Pricing\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 19\\n \\n 19\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0chigh-interest-rate foreign currency. The trader hopes to pay a low interest\\n rate and simultaneously earn a high interest rate. However, this type of carry\\n trade is not without risk. The interest rates may not be fixed, and over the life\\n of the strategy, the interest rate that must be paid on the domestic currency\\n may rise while the interest rate that can be earned on the foreign currency\\n may fall. Moreover, the exchange rate is not fixed. At some point, the trader\\n will have to repay the domestic currency that he borrowed. He expects to do\\n this with the foreign currency that he now owns. If the value of the foreign\\n currency has declined with respect to the domestic currency, it will cost him\\n more to repurchase the domestic currency and repay the loan. The carry\\n trade is sometimes referred to as arbitrage, but in fact, it entails so many risks\\n that the term is probably misapplied.\\n Because cash markets and futures markets are so closely related, a common\\n type of cash-and-carry arbitrage involves buying in the cash market, selling in the\\n futures market, and carrying the position to maturity.\\n Returning to our previous stock example:\\n Stock price S = $67.00\\n Time to maturity t = 8 months\\n Interest rate r = 6.00 percent\\n Expected dividends D = 0.66\\n Ignoring interest on the dividend, the calculated eight-month forward price is\\n 67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 69.02\\n Suppose that there is a market in forward contracts on this stock and that the\\n price of an eight-month forward contract is $69.50. What will a trader do?\\n If the trader believes that the contract is worth only $69.02, he will sell the\\n forward contract at $69.50 and simultaneously buy the stock for $67.00. The\\n cash-and-carry arbitrage profit should be\\n 69.50 – 69.02 = 0.48\\n To confirm this, we can list all the cash flows associated with the transaction,\\n keeping in mind that at maturity the trader will deliver the stock and in return\\n receive the agreed-on forward price of 69.50.\\n Cost of borrowing $67.00 for eight months at\\n 6 percent (67.00 × 0.06 × 8/12)\\n –2.68\\n Cost of buying the stock\\n –67.00\\n Dividend payment of 0.66\\n +0.66\\n Forward price received at maturity\\n +69.50\\n Total of all cash flows\\n +0.48\\n Fluctuations in the price of either the stock or the futures contract will not affect the results. Both the initial stock price ($67.00) and the price to be paid for\\n the stock at maturity ($69.50) are fixed and cannot be changed.\\n Even though fluctuations in the stock or futures price do not represent\\n a risk, other factors may affect the outcome of the strategy. If interest rates\\n rise, the interest costs associated with buying the stock will rise, reducing the\\n 20\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 20\\n \\n V O L A T I L I T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0cpotential profit.7 Moreover, unless the company has actually announced the\\n amount of the dividend, the expected dividend payment might be an estimate based on the company’s past dividend payments. If the company unexpectedly cuts the dividend, the arbitrage profit will be reduced.\\n Given the apparent mispricing of the futures contract, a trader might\\n question his own evaluation. Is $69.02 an accurate forward price? Perhaps the\\n interest rate of 6 percent is too low. Perhaps the dividend of $0.66 is too high.\\n We initially made our calculations by solving for F in terms of the spot\\n price, time, interest rates, and dividends\\n F = [S × (1 + r × t)] – D\\n If we know the forward price F but are missing one of the other values, we can\\n solve for that missing value. If we know the forward price, time to maturity, interest rate, and dividend, we can solve for S, the implied spot price of the underlying contract\\n S=\\n \\n F +D\\n 1+ r × t\\n \\n If we know everything except the interest rate r, we can solve for the implied\\n interest rate\\n r=\\n \\n [( F + D )/S ] − 1\\n t\\n \\n If we know everything except the dividend D, we can solve for the implied\\n dividend\\n D = [S × (1 + r × t)] – F\\n Implied values are an important concept, one that we will return to frequently. If a trader believes that a contract is fairly priced, the implied value\\n must represent the marketplace’s consensus estimate of the missing value.\\n Returning to our eight-month forward contract, suppose that we believe\\n that all values except the interest rate are accurate. What is the implied interest rate?\\n r=\\n =\\n \\n [( F + D )/S ] − 1\\n t\\n [(69.50 + 0.66)/67.00] − 1\\n = 0.0707 (7.07%)\\n 8 /12\\n \\n If we know all values except the dividend, the implied dividend is\\n D = [S × (1 + r × t)] – F = [67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12)] – 69.50 = 0.18\\n If two dividends are expected over the life of the forward contract, the marketplace seems to expect two payments of $0.09 each.\\n If money has been borrowed or lent at a fixed rate, there is no interest-rate risk. However, most traders borrow\\n and lend at a variable rate, resulting in interest-rate risk over the life of the forward contract.\\n 7\\n \\n Forward Pricing\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 21\\n \\n 21\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0cDividends\\n In order to evaluate derivative contracts on stock, a trader may be required to\\n make an estimate of a stock’s future dividend flow. A trader will usually need to\\n estimate the amount of the dividend and the date on which the dividend will be\\n paid. To better understand dividends, it may be useful to define some important terms in the dividend process.\\n \\n Declared Date. The date on which a company announces both the\\n amount of the dividend and the date on which the dividend will be paid. Once\\n the company declares the dividend, the dividend risk is eliminated, at least until\\n the next dividend payment.\\n Record Date. The date on which the stock must be owned in order to receive the dividend. Regardless of the date on which the stock is purchased,\\n ownership of the stock does not become official until the settlement date, the date\\n on which the purchaser of the stock officially takes possession. In the United\\n States, the settlement date for stock is normally three business days after the\\n trade is made (sometimes referred to as T + 3).\\n Trade date\\n \\n Settlement date\\n \\n Ex-Dividend Date (Ex-Date). The first day on which a stock is trading\\n without the rights to the dividend. In the United States, the last day on which\\n a stock can be purchased in order to receive the dividend is three business days\\n prior to the record date. The ex-dividend date is two business days prior to the\\n record date.\\n Ex-dividend date\\n Trade date\\n \\n (Ex-date)\\n \\n Record date\\n Two business days\\n \\n Three business days\\n \\n On the ex-dividend date, quotes for the stock will indicate that the stock is trading ex-div, and all quotes will be posted with the amount of the dividend deducted from the stock price. If a stock closes on the day prior to the ex-dividend\\n date at a price of $67.50 and opens the following day (the ex-dividend date) at\\n a price of $68.25, and the amount of the dividend is $0.40, the price of the\\n stock will read\\n 68.25 + 1.15 ex-div 0.40\\n 22\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 22\\n \\n V O L A T I L I T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0cIf the stock had opened unchanged, the price would have been the previous\\n day’s price of $67.50 less the dividend of $0.40, or $67.10. With the stock at\\n $68.25, its price increase is $1.15.\\n \\n Payable Date. The date on which the dividend will be paid to qualifying\\n shareholders (those owning shares on the record date).\\n The amount of the dividend can often be estimated from the company’s\\n past dividend payments. If a company pays quarterly dividends, as is common\\n in the United States, and has paid a dividend of 25 cents for the last 10 quarters, then it is reasonable to assume that in the future the company will continue to pay 25 cents.\\n We have generally ignored the interest that can be earned on dividends, so\\n it may seem that the date on which the dividend will be paid is not really important. If, however, the date on which the dividend will be paid is expected to fall\\n close to the maturity date of a derivative contract, a slight miscalculation of the\\n dividend date can significantly alter the value of the derivative.\\n \\n Short Sales\\n Many derivatives strategies involve buying and selling either stock or futures\\n contracts. Except for the situation when a market is locked,8 there are no restrictions on the buying or selling of futures contracts. There are also no restrictions\\n on the purchase of stock or on the sale of stock that is already owned. However,\\n there may be situations in which a trader will want to sell stock short, that is, sell\\n stock that he does not already own. The trader hopes to buy back the stock at a\\n later date at a lower price.\\n Depending on the exchange or local regulatory authority, there may be\\n special rules specifying the conditions under which stock can be sold short. In\\n all cases, however, a trader who wants to sell stock short must first borrow the\\n stock. This is possible because many institutions that hold stock may be willing\\n to lend out the stock to facilitate a short sale. A brokerage firm holding a client’s stock may be permitted under its agreement with the client to lend out the\\n stock. This does not mean that one can always borrow stock. Sometimes it will\\n be difficult or even impossible to borrow stock, resulting in a short-stock squeeze.\\n But most actively traded stocks can be borrowed with relative ease, with the\\n borrowing usually facilitated by the trader’s clearing firm.\\n Consider a trader who borrows 900 shares of stock from a brokerage\\n firm in order to sell the stock short at a price of $68 per share. The purchaser will pay the trader $68 × 900, or $61,200, and the trader will deliver\\n the borrowed stock. The purchaser of the stock does not care whether the\\n stock was sold short or long (whether the seller borrowed the stock or actually owned it). As far as the purchaser is concerned, he is now the owner of\\n record of the stock.\\n Some futures exchanges have daily price limits for futures contracts. When a futures contract reaches this\\n limit, the market is said to be locked or locked limit. If the market is either limit up or limit down, no further trading\\n may take place until the price comes off the limit (someone is willing to sell at a price equal to or less than the\\n up limit or buy at a price equal to or higher than the down limit).\\n 8\\n \\n Forward Pricing\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 23\\n \\n 23\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0cBorrowed stock must eventually be returned to the lender, in this case the\\n brokerage firm. As security against this obligation, the brokerage firm will hold\\n the $61,200 proceeds from the sale. Because the $61,200, in theory, belongs\\n to the trader, the firm will pay the trader interest on this amount. At the same\\n time, the trader is obligated to pay the brokerage firm any dividends that accrue\\n over the short-sale period.\\n How does the brokerage firm as the lender profit from this transaction?\\n The lending firm profits because it pays the trader only a portion of the full\\n interest on the $61,200. The exact amount paid to the trader will depend on\\n how difficult it is to borrow the stock. If the stock is easy to borrow, the trader\\n may receive only slightly less than the rate he would expect to receive on any\\n ordinary cash credit. However, if relatively few shares are available for lending,\\n the trader may receive only a fraction of the normal rate. In the most extreme\\n case, where the stock is very difficult to borrow, the trader may receive no\\n interest at all. The rate that the trader receives on the short sale of stock is\\n sometimes referred to as the short-stock rebate.\\n We can make a distinction between the long rate rl that applies to ordinary\\n borrowing and lending and the short rate rs that applies to the short sale of stock.\\n The difference between the long and short rates represents the borrowing costs rbc\\n rl – rs = rbc\\n In a previous example we determined the forward price for a stock\\n Stock price S = $67.00\\n Time to maturity t = 8 months\\n Interest rate r = 6.00 percent\\n Expected dividend payment D = $0.66\\n Ignoring interest on the dividends, the eight-month forward price is\\n 67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 69.02\\n If the price of an eight-month forward contract is $69.50, there is an arbitrage\\n opportunity by selling the forward contract and purchasing the stock. Suppose\\n that instead the eight-month forward contract is trading at a price of $68.75.\\n Now there seems to be an arbitrage opportunity by purchasing the forward contract and selling the stock. Indeed, if a trader already owns the stock, this will result in a profit of $69.02 – $68.75 = $0.27. If, however, the trader does not own\\n stock and must sell the stock short in order to execute the strategy, he will not\\n receive the full interest of 6 percent. If the lending firm will retain 2 percent in\\n borrowing costs, the trader will only receive the short rate of 4 percent. The forward price is now\\n 67.00 × (1 + 0.04 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 68.13\\n If the trader attempts to execute the arbitrage by selling the stock short, he will\\n lose money because\\n 68.13 – 68.75 = –0.62\\n 24\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 24\\n \\n V O L A T I L I T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0cA trader who does not own the stock can only profit if the forward price is\\n less than $68.13 or more than $69.02. Between these prices, no arbitrage is\\n possible.\\n What interest rate should apply to option transactions? Unlike stock, an option\\n is not a deliverable security. It is a contract that is created between a buyer and a\\n seller. Even if a trader does not own a specific option, he need not “borrow” the\\n option in order to sell it. For this reason, we always apply the ordinary long rate\\n to the cash flow resulting from either the purchase or sale of an option.\\n \\n Forward Pricing\\n \\n 02-Natenberg_ch02.indd 25\\n \\n 25\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:22 PM\\n \\n \\x0c3\\n Contract Specifications\\n and Option Terminology\\n Every option market brings together traders and investors with different expectations and goals. Some enter the market with an opinion on which direction prices will move. Some intend to use options to protect existing positions\\n against adverse price movement. Some hope to take advantage of price discrepancies between similar or related products. Some act as middlemen, buying and selling as an accommodation to other market participants and hoping\\n to profit from the difference between the bid price and ask price.\\n Even though expectations and goals differ, every trader’s education must\\n include an understanding of option contract specifications and a mastery of\\n the terminology used in option markets. Without a clear understanding of the\\n terms of an option contract and the rights and responsibilities under that contract, a trader cannot hope to make the best use of options, nor will he be prepared for the very real risks of trading. Without a facility in the language of\\n options, a trader will find it impossible to communicate his desire to buy or sell\\n in the marketplace.\\n \\n Contract Specifications\\n There are several aspects to contract specifications.\\n \\n Type\\n In Chapter 1, we introduced the two types of options. A call option is the right\\n to buy or take a long position in an asset at a fixed price on or before a specified\\n date. A put option is the right to sell or take a short position in an asset.\\n Note the difference between an option and a futures contract. A futures\\n contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The buyer and seller of a futures\\n contract both have clearly defined obligations that they must meet. The seller\\n 26\\n \\n 03-Natenberg_ch03.indd 26\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:27 PM\\n \\n \\x0cmust make delivery, and the buyer must take delivery. The buyer of an option,\\n however, has a choice. He can choose to take delivery (a call) or make delivery (a\\n put). If the buyer of an option chooses to either make or take delivery, the seller\\n of the option is obligated to take the other side. In option trading, all rights lie\\n with the buyer and all obligations with the seller.\\n \\n Underlying\\n The underlying asset or, more simply, the underlying is the security or commodity to be\\n bought or sold under the terms of the option contract. If an option is purchased\\n directly from a bank or other dealer, the quantity of the underlying can be tailored\\n to meet the buyer’s individual requirements. If the option is purchased on an exchange, the quantity of the underlying is set by the exchange. On stock option exchanges, the underlying is typically 100 shares of stock.1 The owner of a call has\\n the right to buy 100 shares; the owner of a put has the right to sell 100 shares. If,\\n however, the price of an underlying stock is either very low or very high, an exchange may adjust the number of shares in the underlying contract in order to\\n create a contract size that is deemed reasonable for trading on the exchange.2\\n On all futures options exchanges, the underlying is uniformly one futures\\n contract. The owner of a call has the right to buy one futures contract; the\\n owner of a put has the right to sell one futures contract. Most often, the underlying for an option on a futures contract is the futures month that corresponds to\\n the expiration month of the option. The underlying for an April futures option\\n is an April futures contract; the underlying for a November futures option is a\\n November futures contract. However, an exchange may also choose to list serial\\n options on futures—option expirations where there is no corresponding futures\\n month. When a futures option has no corresponding futures month, the underlying contract is the nearest futures contract beyond expiration of the option.\\n For example, many financial futures are listed on a quarterly cycle, with\\n trading in March, June, September, and December futures. The underlying for\\n a March option is a March futures contract; the underlying for a June option is\\n a June futures contract. If there are also serial options, then\\n The underlying for a January or February option is a March futures\\n contract.\\n The underlying for an April or May option is a June futures contract.\\n The underlying for a July or August option is a September futures\\n contract.\\n The underlying for an October or November option is a December\\n futures contract.\\n Some interest-rate futures markets [e.g., Eurodollars at the Chicago\\n Mercantile Exchange, Short Sterling and Euribor at the London International Financial Futures Exchange], in addition to listing long-term options\\n on a long-term futures contract, may also list short-term options on the same\\n One hundred shares is sometimes referred to as a round lot. An order to buy or sell fewer than 100 shares is an\\n odd lot.\\n 2\\n Many exchanges also permit trading in flex options, where the buyer and seller may negotiate the contract specifications, including the quantity of the underlying, the expiration date, the exercise price, and the exercise style.\\n 1\\n \\n C o n t r a ct S p e c i f i c a t i o n s a n d O p t i o n T e r m i n o l o g y\\n \\n 03-Natenberg_ch03.indd 27\\n \\n 27\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:27 PM\\n \\n \\x0clong-term futures contract. A March futures contract maturing in two years\\n may be the underlying for a March option expiring in two years. But the same\\n futures contract may also be the underlying for a March option expiring in one\\n year. Short-term options on long-term futures are listed as midcurve options. The\\n options can be one-year midcurve (a short-term option on a futures contract\\n with at least one year to maturity), two-year midcurve (a short-term option on\\n a futures contract with at least two years to maturity), or five-year midcurve\\n (a short-term option on a futures contract with at least five years to maturity).\\n \\n Expiration Date or Expiry\\n The expiration date is the date on which the owner of an option must make the\\n final decision whether to buy, in the case of a call, or to sell, in the case of a put.\\n After expiration, all rights and obligations under the option contract cease to exist.\\n On many stock option exchanges, the expiration date for stock and stock\\n index options is the third Friday of the expiration month.3 Of more importance to most traders is the last trading day, the last business day prior to expiration on which an option can be bought or sold on an exchange. For most stock\\n options, expiration day and the last trading day are the same, the third Friday\\n of the month. However, Good Friday, a legal holiday in many countries, occasionally falls on the third Friday of April. When this occurs, the last trading day\\n is the preceding Thursday.\\n When stock options were introduced in the United States, trading in expiring contracts ended at the close of business on the third Friday of the month.\\n However, many derivative strategies require carrying an offsetting stock position to expiration, at which time the stock position is liquidated. Consequently,\\n stock exchanges found that as the close of trading approached on expiration\\n Friday, they were faced with large orders to buy or sell stock. These large orders often had the effect of disrupting trading or distorting prices at expiration.\\n To alleviate the problem of large order imbalances at expiration, some\\n derivative exchanges, working with the stock exchanges on which the underlying stocks were traded, agreed to establish an expiration value for a derivatives\\n contract based on the opening price of the underlying contract rather than the\\n closing price on the last trading day. This AM expiration is commonly used for\\n stock index contracts. Options on individual stocks are still subject to the traditional PM expiration, where the value of an option is determined by the underlying stock price at the close of trading on the last trading day.\\n Although the expiration date for stock options is relatively uniform, the\\n expiration date for futures options can vary, depending on the underlying commodity or financial instrument. For futures on physical commodities, such as\\n agricultural or energy products, delivery at maturity may take several days. As\\n a consequence, options on futures for physical commodities will often expire\\n several days or even weeks prior to the maturity of the futures contract, most\\n commonly in the month prior to the futures month. An option on a March futures contract will expire in February; an option on a July futures contract will\\n In the early days of option trading, exchange-traded options often expired on a nonbusiness day, typically on a\\n Saturday. This gave the exchange an extra day to process the paperwork associated with expiring options.\\n 3\\n \\n 28\\tOP T ION\\n \\n 03-Natenberg_ch03.indd 28\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND PRI C ING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:27 PM\\n \\n \\x0cexpire in June; an option on a November futures contract will expire in October. A trader will need to consult the exchange calendar to determine the exact\\n expiration date, which is set by each individual exchange.\\n \\n Exercise Price or Strike Price\\n The exercise or strike price is the price at which the underlying will be delivered\\n should the holder of an option choose to exercise his right to buy or sell. If the\\n option is exercised, the owner of a call will pay the exercise price; the owner of\\n a put will receive the exercise price.\\n The exercise prices available for trading on an option exchange are set by\\n the exchange, usually at equal intervals and bracketing the current price of the\\n underlying contract. If the price of the underlying contract is 62 when options\\n are introduced, the exchange may set exercise prices of 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and\\n 75. At a later date, as the price of the underlying moves up or down, the exchange can add additional exercise prices. If the price of the underlying rises to\\n 70, the exchange may add exercise prices of 80, 85, and 90. Additionally, if the\\n exchange feels that it will further facilitate trading, it can introduce intermediate exercise prices—52½, 57½, 62½, 67½.\\n As an example of an exchange-traded option, the buyer of a crude oil October 90 call on the New York Mercantile Exchange has the right to take a long\\n position in one October crude oil futures contract for 1,000 barrels of crude oil\\n (the underlying) at a price of $90 per barrel (the exercise price) on or before the\\n October expiration (the expiration date). The buyer of a General Electric March\\n 30 put on the Chicago Board Options Exchange has the right to take a short position in 100 shares of General Electric stock (the underlying) at a price of $30\\n per share (the exercise price) on or before March expiration (the expiration date).\\n Option contract specifications are further outlined in Figure 3-1.\\n \\n Exercise and Assignment\\n The buyer of a call or a put option has the right to exercise that option prior to\\n its expiration date, thereby converting the option into a long underlying position in the case of a call or a short underlying position in the case of a put. A\\n trader who exercises a crude oil October 90 call has chosen to take a long position in one October crude oil futures contract at $90 per barrel.

Once an option is exercised, the rights and\\n obligations associated with the option cease to exist, just as if the option had\\n been allowed to expire.\\n A trader who intends to exercise an option must submit an exercise notice\\n to either the seller of the option, if purchased from a dealer, or to the exchange,\\n if the option was purchased on an exchange. When a valid exercise notice is\\n submitted, the seller of the option has been assigned. Depending on the type of\\n option, the seller will be required to take a long or short position in the underlying contract at the option’s exercise price.\\n Once a contract has been traded on an exchange, the link between buyer\\n and seller is broken, with the exchange becoming the counterparty to all trades.\\n Still, when a trader exercises an option, the exchange must assign someone to\\n either buy or sell the underlying contract at the exercise price. How does the\\n exchange make this decision? The party who is assigned must be someone who\\n has sold the option and has not closed out the position through an offsetting\\n trade. Beyond this, the exchange’s decision on who will be assigned is essentially random, with no trader having either a greater or lesser probability of\\n being assigned.\\n New traders sometimes become confused about whether the exercise and\\n assignment result in a long position (buying the underlying contract) or a short\\n position (selling the underlying contract). The following summary may help: if you\\n Exercise a call\\t\\t\\n You choose to buy at the exercise price.\\n Are assigned on a call\\n You are required to sell at the exercise price.\\n Exercise a put\\t\\t\\n You choose to sell at the exercise price.\\n Are assigned on a put\\t\\x07You are required to buy at the exercise price\\n Depending on the underlying contract, when an exchange-traded option\\n is exercised, it can settle into\\n 1.

In our examples, whether the price of\\n the stock at exercise is $10 or $1,000, the exerciser of a call pays only the exercise price, not the stock price. The exerciser of a put receives only the exercise\\n price. Of course, the profit or loss resulting from the option trade will depend\\n on both the stock price and the price originally paid for the option. But the cash\\n flow when the option is exercised is independent of these.\\n Settlement into a Futures Position\\n If an option settles into a futures position, it is just as if the exerciser is buying\\n or selling the futures contract at the exercise price. The position is immediately\\n subject to futures-type settlement, requiring a margin deposit and accompanied by a variation payment.\\n An underlying futures contract is currently trading at 85.00 with a point\\n value of $1,000.

If exercise of an option settles into\\n cash, no underlying position results. There is a cash payment equal to the difference between the exercise price and the underlying price at the end of the\\n trading day.\\n C o n t r a ct S p e c i f i c a t i o n s a n d O p t i o n T e r m i n o l o g y\\n \\n 03-Natenberg_ch03.indd 31\\n \\n 31\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:27 PM\\n \\n \\x0cAn underlying index is fixed at the end of the trading day at 300.

A European option can only be exercised at expiration. In practice,\\n this means that the holder of a European option must make the final decision whether to exercise or not on the last business day prior to expiration.\\n In contrast, an American option can be exercised on any business day prior\\n to expiration.\\n The designation of an option’s exercise style as either European or American has nothing to do with geographic location. Many options traded in the\\n United States are European, and many options traded in Europe are American.4 Generally, options on futures and options on individual stocks tend to be\\n American. Options on indexes tend to be European.\\n \\n Option Price Components\\n As in any competitive market, an option’s price, or premium, is determined by\\n supply and demand. Buyers and sellers make competitive bids and offers in the\\n marketplace. When a bid and offer coincide, a trade is made.\\n The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components—\\n the intrinsic value and the time value. An option has intrinsic value if it enables the\\n holder of the option to buy low and sell high or sell high and buy low, with the\\n intrinsic value being equal to the difference between the buying price and the\\n selling price. With an underlying contract trading at $435, the intrinsic value\\n of a 400 call is $35. By exercising the option, the holder of the 400 call can buy\\n at $400. If he then sells at the market price of $435, $35 will be credited to his\\n account. With an underlying contract trading at $62, the intrinsic value of a 70\\n It does appear that the first options traded in the United States carried with them the right of early exercise—\\n hence the term American option.\\n 4\\n \\n 32\\tOP T ION\\n \\n 03-Natenberg_ch03.indd 32\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND PRI C ING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:27 PM\\n \\n \\x0cput is $8. By exercising the option, the holder of the put can sell at $70. If he\\n then buys at the market price of $62, he will show a total credit of $8.\\n A call will only have intrinsic value if its exercise price is less than the current market price of the underlying contract because no one would choose to\\n buy high and sell low. A put will only have intrinsic value if its exercise price is\\n greater than the current market price of the underlying contract because no\\n one would choose to sell low and buy high. The amount of intrinsic value is the\\n amount by which the exercise price is less than the current underlying price in\\n the case of a call or the amount by which the exercise price is greater than the\\n current underlying price in the case of a put. No option can have an intrinsic\\n value less than zero. If S is the spot price of the underlying contract and X is the\\n exercise price, then\\n Call intrinsic value = maximum of either 0 or S – X.\\n Put intrinsic value = maximum of either 0 or X – S.\\n Note that the intrinsic value is independent of the expiration date. With\\n the underlying contract at $83, a March 70 call and a September 70 call both\\n have an intrinsic value of $13. A June 90 put and a December 90 put both have\\n an intrinsic value of $7.\\n Usually, an option’s price in the marketplace will be greater than its intrinsic\\n value. The time value, sometimes also referred to as the option’s time premium or extrinsic value, is the additional amount of premium beyond the intrinsic value that\\n traders are willing to pay for an option. Market participants are willing to pay this\\n additional amount primarily because of the protective characteristics afforded\\n by an option over an outright long or short position in the underlying contract.\\n An option’s premium is always composed of precisely its intrinsic value\\n and its time value. Examples of intrinsic value and time value are shown in\\n Figure 3-2. If a $400 call is trading at $50 with the underlying trading at $435,\\n the time value of the call must be $15 because the intrinsic value is $35. The\\n two components must add up to the option’s total premium of $50. If a $70 put\\n on a stock is trading for $11 with the stock trading at $62, the time value of the\\n put must be $3 because the intrinsic value is $8. Again, the intrinsic value and\\n the time value must add up to the option’s premium of $11.\\n Even though an option’s premium is always composed of its intrinsic value\\n and its time value, one or both of these components can be zero. If the option\\n has no intrinsic value, its price in the marketplace will consist solely of time\\n value. If the option has no time value, its price will consist solely of intrinsic\\n value. In the latter case, traders say that the option is trading at parity.\\n Although an option’s intrinsic value can never be less than zero, it is possible for a European option to have a negative time value. (More about this in\\n Chapter 16 when we look at the early exercise of American options.) When this\\n happens, the option can trade for less than parity. Usually, however, an option’s\\n premium will reflect some nonnegative amount of time value.\\n \\n In the Money, At the Money, and Out of the Money\\n Depending on the relationship between an option’s exercise price and the\\n price of the underlying contract, options are said to be in the money, at the\\n C o n t r a ct S p e c i f i c a t i o n s a n d O p t i o n T e r m i n o l o g y\\n \\n 03-Natenberg_ch03.indd 33\\n \\n 33\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:27 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 3-2\\u2002Intrinsic value and time value.\\n Underlying contract trading at $435\\n April 400 call trading at $50\\n $50\\n \\n Price\\n \\n $11\\n \\n =\\n \\n =\\n \\n =\\n \\n $35\\n ($435 – $400)\\n \\n Intrinsic\\n value\\n \\n $8\\n ($70 – $62)\\n \\n +\\n \\n +\\n \\n +\\n \\n $15\\n ($50 – $35)\\n \\n Time\\n value\\n \\n $3\\n ($11 – $8)\\n \\n Underlying contract trading at $62\\n October 70 put trading at $11\\n \\n money, and out of the money. Any option that has a positive intrinsic value\\n is said to be in the money by the amount of the intrinsic value. With a stock at\\n $44, a $40 call is in the money by $4. A $55 put on the same stock is in the\\n money by $11. An option with no intrinsic value is said to be out of the money,\\n and its price consists solely of time value. In order to be in the money, a call\\n must have an exercise price lower than the current price of the underlying\\n contract, and a put must have an exercise price higher than the current price\\n of the underlying contract. Note that if a call is in the money, a put with the\\n same exercise price and underlying contract must be out of the money. Conversely, if the put is in the money, a call with the same exercise price must be\\n out of the money. In our examples with the stock at $44, the $40 put is out of\\n the money by $4 and the $55 call is out of the money by $11.\\n Finally, an option whose exercise price is equal to the current price of the\\n underlying contract is said to be at the money. Technically, such an option is also\\n out of the money because it has no intrinsic value. Traders make the distinction\\n between at-the-money and out-of-the-money options because, as we shall see,\\n at-the-money options often have very specific and desirable characteristics, and\\n such options tend to be the most actively traded.\\n If we want to be very precise, for an option to be at the money, its exercise price must be exactly equal to the current price of the underlying contract. However, for exchange-traded options, the term is commonly applied\\n to the call and put whose exercise price is closest to the current price of the\\n underlying contract. With a stock at $74 and $5 between exercise prices ($65,\\n $70, $75, $80, etc.), the $75 call and the $75 put are the at-the-money options.\\n These are the call and put options with exercise prices closest to the current\\n price of the underlying contract. In-, at-, and out-of-the-money options are\\n outlined in Figure 3-3.\\n 34\\tOP T ION\\n \\n 03-Natenberg_ch03.indd 34\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND PRI C ING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:27 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 3-3\\u2002In-, at-, and out-of-the-money options.\\n Current underlying price\\n In-the-money calls\\n \\n Out-of-the-money calls\\n \\n Lower exercise prices\\n \\n Higher exercise prices\\n \\n Out-of-the-money puts\\n \\n In-the-money puts\\n \\n At-the-money calls and puts\\n \\n Automatic Exercise\\n At expiration an in-the-money option will always have some intrinsic value. A\\n trader can capture this value by either selling the option in the marketplace prior\\n to expiration or exercising the option and immediately closing the underlying\\n position. When exchange-traded options were first introduced, anyone wishing to exercise an option was required to formally submit an exercise notice to the\\n exchange. If someone forgot to submit an exercise notice for an in-the-money\\n option, the option would expire unexercised, and the trader would lose the intrinsic value. This is an outcome that no rational person would accept. Unfortunately, in the early days of option trading, this occurred occasionally for various\\n reasons: perhaps the trader was unaware that he was required to submit an exercise notice, perhaps the trader was out of communication with the exchange\\n and was therefore unable to submit an exercise notice, or perhaps there was an\\n error on the part of the clearing firm in processing the exercise notice.\\n To avoid a situation where an in-the-money option expires unexercised,\\n which would be an embarrassment to both the individual trader and the exchange, most exchanges have instituted an automatic exercise policy. The exchange\\n will exercise on behalf of the option holder any in-the-money option at expiration, even if an exercise notice has not been submitted. The criteria for automatic exercise may vary from one exchange to another and may also vary\\n depending on who holds the option. For example, because of transaction costs,\\n it may not be economically worthwhile to exercise an option that is only very\\n slightly in the money. Therefore, the exchange may automatically exercise only\\n options that are in the money by some predetermined amount. If the automatic exercise threshold is 0.05, then an option must be in the money by at\\n least 0.05 in order for the exchange to exercise the option. If the option is in the\\n money by 0.03, a trader may still exercise the option but must do so by submitting an exercise notice. On the opposite side, if the option is in the money by\\n 0.06, a trader who feels that the option is not worth exercising may submit a do\\n not exercise notice. Otherwise, the exchange will automatically exercise the option\\n on the trader’s behalf.\\n Because professional traders and retail customers have different cost\\n structures, the exchange may have a different automatic exercise threshold for\\n C o n t r a ct S p e c i f i c a t i o n s a n d O p t i o n T e r m i n o l o g y\\n \\n 03-Natenberg_ch03.indd 35\\n \\n 35\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:27 PM\\n \\n \\x0ceach party. The threshold may be 0.05 for retail customers but only 0.02 for\\n professionals. To determine who is a professional trader and who is not, an exchange will usually specify the criteria necessary for inclusion in each category.\\n \\n Option Margining\\n Depending on the exchange and the type of underlying contract, options can\\n be subject to either stock-type settlement or futures-type settlement. However,\\n once an option trade is made, there are additional risks that the clearinghouse\\n must consider. Is the risk to an option position limited or unlimited? If unlimited, how should the clearinghouse protect itself ?\\n When the risk of an option position is limited, the margin that must be deposited with the clearinghouse will never be greater than the maximum risk to\\n the position. The buyer of an option can never have risk greater than the premium paid for the option, and the clearinghouse will never require a margin\\n deposit greater than this amount. Even if an option position is very complex, as\\n long as there is a maximum risk to the position, there will also be a maximum\\n margin requirement.\\n Some option positions, however, have unlimited risk. For such positions,\\n the clearinghouse must consider the risk associated with a wide variety of outcomes. Once this is done, the clearinghouse can require a margin deposit commensurate with the perceived risk of the position. Unlike futures margining,\\n where the clearinghouse sets a fixed margin deposit for each open futures position, there is no single method of determining the margin for a complex option position. However, all methods are risk-based, requiring an analysis of the\\n position’s risk under a broad range of market conditions. In the United States,\\n the Options Clearing Corporation has developed its own risked-based margining system for stock and index options. The most widely used margining system on futures exchanges is the Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) system\\n developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Both margining systems create an array of possible outcomes with respect to both the underlying price and\\n the perceived speed with which the underlying price can change. The clearinghouse then uses this array to determine a reasonable margin requirement.5\\n \\n A description of SPAN margining can be found at http://www.cmegroup.com/clearing/risk-management.

Unlike a trader in equities or futures, whose\\n choices are limited to a small number of instruments, an option trader must often deal with a bewildering assortment of contracts. With several expiration\\n months, with multiple exercise prices available in each month, and with both\\n calls and puts at each exercise price, it is not unusual for an option trader to be\\n faced with what at first seems like an overwhelming number of different contracts. With so many choices available, a trader needs some logical method of\\n deciding which options actually represent profit opportunities. Which should he\\n buy? Which should he sell? Which should he avoid? The choices are so numerous that a prospective option trader might be inclined to give up in frustration.\\n To begin, a trader might ask a very obvious question: what is an option\\n worth? The question may be obvious, but the answer, unfortunately, is not, because option prices can be affected by many different market forces. However,\\n there is one time in an option’s life when everyone ought to be able to agree on\\n the option’s value. At expiration, an option is worth exactly its intrinsic value:\\n zero if it is out of the money or the difference between the underlying price and\\n the exercise price if it is in the money.\\n Following is a series of underlying prices and the value at expiration for\\n two options, a $95 call and $110 put:\\n Underlying Price\\n \\n 95 Call\\n \\n 110 Put\\n \\n 80\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 30\\n \\n 85\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 25\\n \\n 90\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 20\\n \\n 95\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 15\\n \\n 100\\n \\n 5\\n \\n 10\\n 37\\n \\n 04-Natenberg_ch04.indd 37\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cUnderlying Price\\n \\n 95 Call\\n \\n 110 Put\\n \\n 105\\n \\n 10\\n \\n 5\\n \\n 110\\n \\n 15\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 115\\n \\n 20\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 120\\n \\n 25\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 125\\n \\n 30\\n \\n 0\\n \\n For the 95 call, if the underlying price at expiration is 95 or below, the call is\\n out of the money and therefore worthless. If, however, the underlying price rises\\n above 95, the 95 call will go into the money, gaining one point in value for each\\n point that the underlying price rises above 95. For the 110 put, if the underlying\\n price is 110 or above, the put is out of the money and therefore worthless. But\\n if the underlying price falls below 110, the 110 put goes into the money, gaining\\n one point in value for each point decline in the underlying price.\\n \\n Parity Graphs\\n For someone who has bought an option, the intrinsic value represents a credit,\\n or positive value. The buyer of the option will be able to buy low and sell high.\\n For someone who has sold an option, the intrinsic value represents a debit, or\\n negative value. The seller of the option will be forced to buy high and sell low.\\n We can use an option’s intrinsic value to draw a graph of the value of an option position at expiration as a function of the price of the underlying contract.\\n Figure 4-1 shows such a graph for a long call position. Below the exercise price,\\n the option has no value. Above the exercise price, the option gains one point in\\n value for each point increase in the underlying price.\\n \\n Position value\\n \\n Figure 4-1 Long call.\\n \\n 38\\n \\n Exercise\\n price\\n \\n +1\\n +1\\n \\n 0\\n Lower underlying prices\\n \\n Higher underlying prices\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 04-Natenberg_ch04.indd 38\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cPosition value\\n \\n Figure 4-2\\u2002Short call.\\n \\n Lower underlying prices\\n \\n Higher underlying prices\\n \\n 0\\n \\n Exercise\\n price\\n \\n +1\\n –1\\n \\n Figure 4-2 shows the value of a short call position at expiration. Now, if the\\n option is in the money, the value of the position is negative. For every point the\\n underlying rises above the exercise price, the position loses one point in value.\\n We can create the same type of expiration graphs for long and short put\\n positions, as shown in Figures 4-3 and 4-4. For a long or short put, the value of\\n the position is zero if the underlying price is above the exercise price. For a long\\n put, the position gains one point for each point decline in the underlying price.\\n For a short put, the position loses one point in value for each point decline in\\n the underlying price.\\n A parity graph represents the value of an option position at expiration,\\n parity being another name for intrinsic value.

Buyers of options have limited risk (they can never\\n lose more than the price of the option) and unlimited profit potential. Sellers of\\n options have limited profit potential (they can never make more than the price\\n of the option) and unlimited risk.1\\n Given the apparently unbalanced risk-reward tradeoff, new option traders\\n tend to have the same reaction: why would anyone do anything other than buy\\n options? The purchase of an option results in a position with limited risk and unlimited profit, which certainly seems more desirable than the limited profit and\\n unlimited risk that result from the sale of an option. Yet, in every option market,\\n there are traders who are willing to sell options. Why are they willing to do this in\\n the face of this apparently unbalanced risk-reward tradeoff? The answer has to\\n do with not just the best and worst that can happen but also with the likelihood\\n of those occurrences. It’s true that someone who sells an option is exposed to unlimited risk, but if the amount received for the option is great enough and the\\n perceived risk is low enough, a trader might be willing to take that risk. In later\\n chapters we will see the very important role probability plays in option pricing.\\n \\n Slope\\n From the parity graphs, we can see that if an option is out of the money, its value\\n is unaffected by changes in the price of the underlying contract. If the option\\n is in the money, it will either gain or lose value as the underlying price changes.\\n Admittedly, in traditional stock and commodity markets, a put does not represent unlimited profit potential to\\n the buyer nor unlimited risk to the seller because the underlying contract cannot fall below zero. But for practical purposes most traders think of both calls and puts as having unlimited potential value.\\n 1\\n \\n 40\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 04-Natenberg_ch04.indd 40\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cThe slope of the graph is the change in value of the option position with respect\\n to changes in the price of the underlying contract, often expressed as a fraction\\n slope =\\n \\n change in position value\\n change in underlying price\\n \\n We can summarize the slopes of the basic positions as follows:\\n Position\\n \\n Slope\\n \\n Long or short any out-of-the-money option\\n \\n 0\\n \\n Long an in-the-money call\\n \\n +1\\n \\n Short an in-the-money call\\n \\n –1\\n \\n Long an in-the-money put\\n \\n –1\\n \\n Short an in-the-money put\\n \\n +1\\n \\n In addition to parity graphs for individual options, we can also create parity graphs for positions consisting of multiple options by adding up the slopes\\n of the individual options. Figure 4-5 is the parity graph of a position consisting\\n of a long call and long put at the same exercise price. We can calculate the total slopes as follows:\\n Below the exercise price\\n \\n Call is out of the money\\n \\n Slope\\n \\n 0\\n \\n Put is in the money\\n \\n –1\\n \\n Total slope below the exercise price\\n \\n –1\\n \\n Above the exercise price\\n \\n Slope\\n \\n Put is out of the money\\n \\n 0\\n \\n Call is in the money\\n \\n +1\\n \\n Total slope above the exercise price\\n \\n +1\\n \\n The combined position will gain value if the underlying price moves in either\\n direction away from the exercise price. The position is typical of many option\\n strategies that may be sensitive to the magnitude of movement in the underlying contract rather than the direction of movement.\\n Many option strategies involve combining options with the underlying\\n contract, so we will also want to consider the slope of an underlying position.\\n As shown in Figure 4-6, the slope of a long underlying position is always +1,\\n and the slope of a short underlying position is always –1. The slopes are constant regardless of the underlying price. This is an important distinction between an option position and an underlying position.

Above the exercise price, the total slope is +1 (+2\\n for the in-the-money calls, –1 for the short underlying contract). This parity\\n graph is identical to the position in Figure 4-5, which must mean that the same\\n option strategy can be constructed in more than one way. This is an important characteristic of options that we will look at in more detail in Chapter 14.\\n Note also that the location of the underlying position is irrelevant to the parity\\n graph. Regardless of the price of the underlying, the slope is always either +1\\n for a long underlying position or –1 for a short underlying position.\\n \\n Figure 4-7 (a ) Long two calls and short an underlying contract.

Nevertheless, the parity graph tells us something about the\\n characteristics of the position. Here we can see that the potential profit on\\n the downside, as well as the potential loss on the upside, is unlimited.\\n \\n Expiration Profit and Loss\\n A parity graph may tell us the characteristics of an option position at expiration, but an equally important consideration will be the profit or loss that\\n results from the position. Whether the position makes or loses money will depend on the prices at which the contracts are bought and sold. The purchase\\n of options will create a debit, whereas the sale of options will create a credit.\\n For a simple option position, the expiration profit and loss (P&L) graph will be\\n the parity graph shifted downward by the amount of any debit or upward by\\n the amount of any credit.\\n Consider the following option prices with the underlying contract trading\\n at a price of 98.00:\\n 85\\n \\n 90\\n \\n 95\\n \\n 100\\n \\n 105\\n \\n 110\\n \\n 115\\n \\n Calls\\n \\n 14.25\\n \\n 9.75\\n \\n 6.25\\n \\n 3.50\\n \\n 1.75\\n \\n 0.75\\n \\n 0.25\\n \\n Puts\\n \\n 0.25\\n \\n 1.00\\n \\n 2.25\\n \\n 4.50\\n \\n 7.75\\n \\n 11.75\\n \\n 16.25\\n \\n Figure 4-10 shows the parity graph of a long 100 call position.

If the underlying is anywhere below 100 at expiration, the option will be worthless, and\\n the position will lose 3.50. With the underlying above 100, the slope of the\\n graph is +1; the option will gain one point in value for each point increase\\n in the price of the underlying. We can also see that there is a breakeven price at\\n which the option position will be worth exactly 3.50. Logically, this must occur at an underlying price of 103.50.\\n Figure 4-11 shows the parity graph of a short 95 put position. If the option is sold at a price of 2.25, we can construct the expiration P&L graph by\\n shifting the entire graph up by this amount. With an underlying price anywhere above 95 at expiration, the option will be worthless, and the position\\n will show a profit of 2.25. With an underlying price below 95, the slope of the\\n graph is +1; the position will lose one point for each point decline in the price\\n of the underlying. The breakeven price for the position is 92.75, the price at\\n which the 95 put will be worth exactly 2.25.\\n The relative expiration value of long option positions at different exercise\\n prices—95, 100, and 105—is shown in Figure 4-12. The same relative value\\n for long put positions is shown in Figure 4-13. Calls with lower exercise prices\\n have greater values (i.e., they enable the holder to buy at a lower price), whereas\\n puts with higher exercise prices have greater values (i.e., they enable the holder\\n to sell at a higher price).\\n For more complex positions, it may not be immediately clear whether\\n the position will result in a credit or debit. In this case, we can construct an\\n expiration P&L graph by first determining the slopes of the graph over all\\n the intervals. Then we can calculate the P&L at one point, and from this\\n one P&L point, we can use the slopes to determine the P&L at all other\\n points.\\n \\n Figure 4-11\\u2002Short a 95 put at a price of 2.25.\\n \\n Profit or loss at expiration\\n \\n 95\\n Breakeven\\n 92.75\\n +2.25\\n 0\\n \\n –1\\n –1\\n Parity graph\\n \\n Expiration P&L graph\\n \\n E x piration P rofit and L o s s\\n \\n 04-Natenberg_ch04.indd 47\\n \\n 47\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 4-12 Long a 95 call –6.25; long a 100 call –3.50; long a 105 call –1.75.\\n 105 call\\n \\n Long a 95 Call –6.25\\n Long a 100 Call –3.50\\n Long a 105 Call –1.75\\n \\n 100 call\\n \\n Profit or loss at expiration\\n \\n 95 call\\n \\n 95\\n \\n 100\\n \\n 105\\n \\n 0\\n –1.75\\n –3.50\\n 101.25 103.50\\n –6.25\\n \\n 106.75\\n \\n Breakeven prices\\n \\n Figure 4-13 Long a 95 put –2.25; long a 100 put –4.50; long a 105 put –7.75.\\n \\n 95 put\\n \\n Long a 95 Put –2.25\\n Long a 100 Put –4.50\\n Long a 105 Put –7.75\\n \\n 100 put\\n \\n Profit or loss at expiration\\n \\n 105 put\\n \\n 95\\n \\n 100\\n \\n 105\\n \\n 0\\n –2.25\\n \\n 92.75\\n \\n 95.50 97.25\\n \\n –4.50\\n \\n Breakeven prices\\n –7.75\\n \\n 48\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 04-Natenberg_ch04.indd 48\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cConsider the following position\\n Position\\n \\n Contract Price\\n \\n +1 95 call\\n \\n 6.25\\n \\n –1 105 call\\n \\n 1.75\\n \\n –2 105 puts\\n \\n 7.75\\n \\n –2 Underlying contracts\\n \\n 98.00\\n \\n The slopes of the position are\\n Contract\\n \\n Below 95\\n \\n 95–105\\n \\n Above 105\\n \\n +1 95 call\\n \\n 0\\n \\n +1\\n \\n +1\\n \\n –1 105 call\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 0\\n \\n –1\\n \\n –2 105 puts\\n \\n +2\\n \\n +2\\n \\n 0\\n \\n –2 Underlying contracts\\n \\n –2\\n \\n –2\\n \\n –2\\n \\n 0\\n \\n +1\\n \\n –2\\n \\n Total\\n \\n It is usually easiest to determine the P&L at an exercise price, so let’s use\\n 95.

From the expiration\\n profit and loss (P&L) graphs, we can see clearly that the direction in which an\\n underlying contract moves can be an important consideration in choosing an\\n option strategy. A trader who believes that the underlying market will rise will\\n be more inclined either to buy calls or sell puts. A trader who believes that the\\n underlying market will fall will be more inclined either to buy puts or sell calls.\\n In each case, the directional movement in the underlying market will increase\\n the likelihood that the strategy will be profitable.\\n However, an option trader has an additional problem that we might call\\n the “speed” of the market. If we ignore interest and dividend considerations,\\n a trader who believes that a stock will rise in price within a specified period can\\n be reasonably certain of making a profit if he is right. He can simply buy the\\n stock, wait for it to reach his target price, and then sell the stock at a profit.\\n The situation is not quite so simple for an option trader. Suppose that a\\n trader believes that a stock will rise in price from $100, its present price, to $115\\n within the next five months. Suppose also that a $110 call expiring in three\\n months is available at a price of $2. If the stock rises to $115 by expiration, the\\n purchase of the $110 call will result in a profit of $3 ($5 intrinsic value minus\\n the $2 cost of the option). But is this profit a certainty? What will happen if\\n the price of the stock remains below $110 for the next three months and only\\n reaches $115 after the option expires? Then the option will expire worthless,\\n and the trader will lose his $2 investment.\\n Perhaps the trader would do better to purchase a $110 call that expires in\\n six months rather than three months. Now he can be certain that when the stock\\n reaches $115, the call will be worth at least $5 in intrinsic value. But what if the\\n price of the six-month option is $6? In this case, the trader still might show a\\n loss. Even if the underlying stock reaches the target price of $115, there is no\\n guarantee that the $110 call will ever be worth more than its $5 intrinsic value.\\n 52\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 52\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cA trader in an underlying market is interested almost exclusively in the direction in which the market will move. Although an option trader is also sensitive to directional considerations, he must also give some thought to how fast the\\n market is likely to move. If a trader in the underlying stock and an option trader\\n in the same market take long market positions in their respective instruments\\n and the market does in fact move higher, the stock trader is assured of a profit,\\n while the option trader may show a loss. If the market fails to move sufficiently\\n fast, the favorable directional move may not be enough to offset the option’s loss\\n in time value. A speculator will often buy options for their seemingly favorable\\n risk-reward characteristics (limited risk, unlimited reward), but if he purchases\\n options, not only must he be right about market direction, he must also be right\\n about market speed. Only if he is right on both counts can he expect to make a\\n profit. If predicting the correct market direction is difficult, correctly predicting\\n direction and speed is probably beyond most traders’ capabilities.\\n The concept of speed is crucial in trading options. Indeed, many option\\n strategies depend only on the speed of the underlying market and not at all on\\n its direction. If a trader is highly proficient at predicting directional moves in\\n the underlying market, he is probably better advised to trade the underlying instrument. Only when a trader has some feel for the speed component can he\\n hope to successfully enter the option market.\\n \\n The Importance of Probability\\n One can never be certain about future market conditions, so almost all trading\\n decisions are based on some estimate of probability. We often express our opinions about probability using words such as likely, good chance, possible, and probable. But in an option evaluation we need to be more specific. We need to define\\n probability in way that will enable us to do the types of calculations required\\n to make intelligent decisions in the marketplace. If we can do this, we will find\\n that probability and the choice of strategy go hand in hand. If a trader believes\\n that a strategy has a very high probability of profit and a very low probability of loss, he will be satisfied with a small potential profit because the profit is\\n likely to be quite secure. On the other hand, if the probability of profit is very\\n low, the trader will demand a large profit when market conditions develop favorably. Because of the importance of probability in the decision-making process, it will be worthwhile to consider some simple probability concepts.\\n \\n Expected Value\\n Suppose that we are given the opportunity to roll a six-sided die, and each time\\n we roll, we will be paid a dollar amount equal to the number that comes up. If we\\n roll a one, we are paid $1; if we roll a two, we are paid $2; and so on up to six, in\\n which case we are paid $6. If we are given the opportunity to roll the die an infinite number of times, on average, how much do we expect to receive per roll?\\n We can calculate the answer using some simple arithmetic. There are six\\n possible numbers, each with equal probability. If we add up the six possible\\n outcomes 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 and divide this by the six faces on the die,\\n Theoretical Pricing Models\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 53\\n \\n 53\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cwe get 21/6 = 3½. That is, on average, we can expect to get back $3½ each\\n time we roll the die. This is the average payback, or expected value. If we must\\n pay for the privilege of rolling the die, what is a reasonable price? If we purchase the chance to roll the die for less than $3½, in the long run, we expect to\\n show a profit. If we pay more than $3½, in the long run, we expect to show a\\n loss. And if we pay exactly $3½, we expect to break even. Note the qualifying\\n phrase in the long run. The expected value of $3½ is realistic only if we are allowed to roll the die many, many times. If we are allowed to roll only once, we\\n cannot be certain of getting back $3½. Indeed, on any one roll, it is impossible\\n to get back $3½ because no face of the die has exactly 3½ spots. Nevertheless,\\n if we pay less than $3½ for even one roll of the die, the laws of probability are\\n on our side because we have paid less than the expected value.\\n In a similar vein, consider a roulette bet. The roulette wheel has 38 slots,\\n numbers 1 through 36 and 0 and 00.1 Suppose that a casino allows a player to\\n choose a number. If the player’s number comes up, he receives $36; if any other\\n number comes up, he receives nothing. What is the expected value for this proposition? There are 38 slots on the roulette wheel, each with equal probability, but\\n only one slot will return $36 to the player. If we divide the one outcome where\\n the player wins $36 by the 38 slots on the wheel, the result is $36/38 = $0.9474,\\n or about 95 cents. A player who pays 95 cents for the privilege of picking a number at the roulette table can expect to approximately break even in the long run.\\n Of course, no casino will let a player buy such a bet for 95 cents. Under\\n those conditions, the casino would make no profit. In the real world, a player\\n who wants to purchase such a bet will have to pay more than the expected return, typically $1. The 5-cent difference between the $1 price of the bet and\\n the 95-cent expected value represents the profit potential, or edge, to the casino.\\n In the long run, for every dollar bet at the roulette table, the casino can expect\\n to keep about 5 cents.\\n Given the preceding conditions, any player interested in making a profit\\n would rather switch places with the casino. Then he would have a 5-cent edge\\n on his side by selling bets worth 95 cents for $1. Alternatively, the player would\\n like to find a casino where he could purchase the bet for less than its expected\\n value of 95 cents, perhaps 88 cents. Then the player would have a 7-cent edge\\n over the casino.\\n \\n Theoretical Value\\n The theoretical value of a proposition is the price one would be willing to pay now\\n to just break even in the long run. Thus far, the only factor we have considered\\n in determining the value of a proposition is the expected value. We used this\\n concept to calculate the 95-cent fair price for the roulette bet.\\n Suppose that in our roulette example the casino decides to change the conditions slightly. The player may now purchase the roulette bet for its expected\\n value of 95 cents, and as before, if he loses, the casino will immediately collect\\n We assume a roulette wheel with 38 slots, as is customary in the United States. In some parts of the world, a\\n roulette wheel may have no slot numbered 00. This, of course, changes the probabilities.\\n 1\\n \\n 54\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 54\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0chis 95 cents. Under the new conditions, however, if the player wins, the casino\\n will send him his $36 winnings in two months. Will both the player and the casino still break even on the proposition?\\n Where did the player get the 95 cents that he bet at the roulette wheel? In\\n the immediate sense, he may have taken it out of his pocket. But a closer examination may reveal that he withdrew the money from his bank prior to visiting\\n the casino. Because he won’t receive his winnings for two months, he will have\\n to take into consideration the two months of interest he would have earned had\\n he left the 95 cents in the bank. The theoretical value of the bet is really the present value of its expected value, the 95 cents expected value discounted by interest. If interest rates are 12 percent annually, the theoretical value is\\n 95 cents/(1 + 0.12 × 2/12) ≈ 93 cents\\n Even if the player purchases the bet for its expected return of 95 cents, he\\n will still lose 2 cents because of the interest that he could have earned for two\\n months if he had left his money in the bank. The casino, on the other hand, will\\n take the 95 cents, put it in an interest-bearing account, and at the end of two\\n months collect 2 cents in interest. Under the new conditions, if a player pays 93\\n cents for the roulette bet today and receives his winnings in two months, neither\\n he nor the casino can expect to make any profit in the long run.\\n The two most common considerations in option evaluation are the\\n expected return and interest. There may, however, be other considerations.\\n Suppose that the player is a good client, and the casino decides to send him\\n a 1-cent bonus a month from now. He can add this additional payment to\\n the previous theoretical value of 93 cents to get a new theoretical value of\\n 94 cents. This is similar to the dividend paid to owners of stock in a company.\\n In fact, dividends can be an additional consideration in evaluating both stock\\n and options on stock.\\n If a casino is selling roulette bets that have an expected value of 95 cents for\\n a price of $1, does this guarantee that the casino will make a profit? It does if\\n the casino can be certain of staying in business for the “long run” because over\\n long periods of time the good and bad luck will tend to even out. Unfortunately,\\n before the casino reaches the long run, it must survive the short run. It’s possible\\n that someone can walk up to the roulette wheel, make a series of bets, and have\\n their number come up 20 times in succession. Clearly, this is very unlikely, but\\n the laws of probability say that it could happen. If the player’s good luck results\\n in the casino going out of business, the casino will never reach the long run.\\n The goal of option evaluation is to determine, through the use of a theoretical pricing model, the theoretical value of an option. The trader can then\\n make an intelligent decision whether the price of the option in the marketplace\\n is either too low or too high and whether the theoretical edge is sufficient to justify making a trade. But determining the theoretical value is only half the problem. Because an option’s theoretical value is based on the laws of probability,\\n which are only reliable in the long run, the trader must also consider the question of risk. Even if a trader has correctly calculated an option’s theoretical\\n value, how will he control the short-term bad luck that goes with any probability calculation? We shall see that in the real world, an option’s theoretical value\\n Theoretical Pricing Models\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 55\\n \\n 55\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cis always open to question. For this reason, a trader’s ability to manage risk is at\\n least as important as his ability to calculate a theoretical value.\\n \\n A Word on Models\\n What is a model? We can think of a model as a scaled-down or more easily managed representation of the real world. The model may be a physical one, such as\\n a model airplane or architectural model, or it may be a mathematical one, such as\\n a formula. In each case, we use the model to better understand the world around\\n us. However, it is unwise, and sometimes dangerous, to assume that the model\\n and the real world that it represents are identical in every way. We may have an\\n excellent model, but it is unlikely to be an exact replica of the real world.\\n All models, if they are to be effective, require us to make certain prior\\n assumptions about the real world. Mathematical models require the input\\n of numbers that quantify these assumptions. If we feed incorrect data into a\\n model, we can expect an incorrect representation of the real world. As every\\n model user knows, “Garbage in, garbage out.”\\n These general observations about models are no less true for option pricing models. An option model is only someone’s idea of how an option might\\n be evaluated under certain conditions. Because either the model itself or the\\n data that we feed into the model might be incorrect, there is no guarantee that\\n model-generated values will be accurate. Nor can we be sure that these values\\n will bear any logical resemblance to actual prices in the marketplace.\\n A new option trader is like someone entering a dark room for the first time.\\n Without any guidance, he may grope around, hoping that he eventually finds\\n what he is looking for. The trader who is armed with a basic understanding of\\n theoretical pricing models enters the same room with a candle. He can make out\\n the general layout of the room, but the dimness of the candle prevents him from\\n distinguishing every detail. Moreover, some of what he sees may be distorted by\\n the flickering of the candle. In spite of these limitations, a trader is more likely to\\n find what he is looking for with a small candle than with no illumination at all.2\\n The real problems with theoretical pricing models arise after the trader\\n has acquired some sophistication. As he gains confidence, he may begin to\\n increase the size of his trades. When this happens, his inability to make out\\n every detail in the room, as well as the distortions caused by the flickering candle flame, take on increased importance. Now a misinterpretation of what he\\n thinks he sees can lead to financial disaster because any error in judgment will\\n be greatly magnified.\\n The sensible approach is to make use of a model, but with a full awareness\\n of what it can and cannot do. Option traders will find that a theoretical pricing\\n model is an invaluable tool to understanding the pricing of options. Because of\\n the insights gained from a model, the great majority of successful option traders rely on some type of theoretical pricing model. However, an option trader,\\n if he is to make the best use of a theoretical pricing model, must be aware of its\\n One might also argue that a trader with a candle (i.e., theoretical pricing model) might drop the candle and burn\\n down the entire building. Financial crises seem to occur when many traders drop their candles at the same time.\\n 2\\n \\n 56\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 56\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0climitations as well as its strengths. Otherwise, he may be no better off than the\\n trader groping in the dark.3\\n \\n A Simple Approach\\n How might we adapt the concepts of expected value and theoretical value to\\n the pricing of options? Consider an underlying contract that at expiration can\\n take on one of five different prices: $80, $90, $100, $110, or $120. Assume,\\n moreover, that each of the five prices is equally likely with 20 percent probability. The prices and probabilities are shown Figure 5-1.\\n What will be the expected value for this contract at expiration? Twenty\\n percent of the time, the contract will be worth $80; 20 percent of the time,\\n the contract will be worth $90; and so on, up to the 20 percent of the time, the\\n contract is worth $120:\\n (20% × $80) + (20% × $90) + (20% × 100) + (20% × $110)\\n + (20% × $120) = $100\\n At expiration, the expected value for the contract is $100.\\n Now consider the expected value of a 100 call using the same underlying\\n prices and probabilities. We can more easily see the value of the call by overlaying the parity graph for the call on our probability distribution. This has been\\n done in Figure 5-2. If the underlying contract is at $80, $90, or $100, the call\\n is worthless. If, however, the underlying contract is at $110 or $120, the option\\n will be worth its intrinsic value of $10 and $20, respectively:\\n (20% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (20% × $10) + (20% × $20) = $6\\n If we want to develop a theoretical pricing model using this approach, we\\n might propose a series of possible prices and probabilities for the underlying\\n contract at expiration. Then, given an exercise price, we can calculate the intrinsic value of the option at each underlying price, multiply this value by its associated probability, add up all these numbers, and thereby obtain an expected\\n value for the option. The expected value for a call at expiration is\\n n\\n \\n ∑ p max (S\\n i =1\\n \\n i\\n \\n i\\n \\n − X ,0)\\n \\n where each Si is a possible underlying price at expiration, and pi is the probability associated with that price.

Obviously, this is not very realistic. What changes might we make to develop a model that more accurately reflects the real world? For one thing, we need to know the settlement procedure\\n for the option. If the option is subject to stock-type settlement, we must pay the\\n full price of the option. If the 100 call has an expected value of $6 at expiration, the theoretical value will be the present value of this amount. If interest\\n rates are 12 percent annually (1 percent per month) and the option will expire\\n in two months, the theoretical value of the option is\\n $6.00\\n $6.00\\n =\\n ≈ $5.88\\n 1 + (0.12 × 2 /12) 1.02\\n What other factors might we consider? We assumed that all five price outcomes were equally likely. Is this a realistic assumption? Suppose that you were\\n told that only two prices were possible at expiration, $110 and $250. If the current price of the underlying contract is close to $100, which do you think is more\\n likely? Experience suggests that extreme price changes that are far away from today’s price are less likely than small changes that remain close to today’s price. For\\n this reason, $110 is more likely than $250. Perhaps our probability distribution\\n ought to reflect this by concentrating the probabilities around the current price of\\n 58\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 58\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 5-3\\n \\n 40%\\n \\n +1\\n +1\\n \\n 20%\\n \\n 20%\\n 10%\\n \\n 10%\\n \\n Underlying price:\\n \\n 80\\n \\n 90\\n \\n 100\\n \\n 110\\n \\n 120\\n \\n Value of 100 call:\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 10\\n \\n 20\\n \\n the underlying contract.

Because the probabilities are symmetrical around $100, the\\n expected value for the underlying contract at expiration is still $100.\\n No matter how we assign probabilities, we will want to do so in such a way\\n that the expected value for the underlying contract represents the most likely,\\n or average, value at expiration. What is the most likely future value for the underlying contract? In fact, there is no way to know. But we might ask what the\\n marketplace thinks the most likely value is. Recall what would happen if the\\n theoretical forward price were different from the actual price of a forward contract in the marketplace. Everyone would execute an arbitrage by either buying\\n or selling the forward contract and taking the opposite position in the cash market. In a sense, the marketplace must think that the forward price is the most\\n likely future value for the underlying contract. If we assume that the underlying\\n market is arbitrage-free, the expected value for the underlying contract must be\\n equal to the forward price.\\n Suppose in our example that the underlying contract is a stock that is currently trading at $100 and that pays no dividend prior to expiration. The twomonth forward price for the stock is\\n $100 × [1 + (0.12 × 2/12) ] = $100 × 1.02 = $102\\n If $102 is the expected value for the stock, instead of assigning the probabilities symmetrically around $100, we may want to assign them symmetrically\\n Theoretical Pricing Models\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 59\\n \\n 59\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0caround $102. This distribution is shown in Figure 5-4. Now the expected value\\n for the 100 call is\\n (10% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (40% × $2) + (20% × $12) + (10% × $22) = $5.40\\n and the theoretical value is\\n $5.40\\n ≈ $5.29\\n 1.02\\n In the examples thus far, we have assumed a symmetrical probability distribution. But as long as the expected value is equal to the forward price, there\\n is no requirement that the probabilities be assigned symmetrically. Figure 5-5\\n shows a distribution where the price outcomes are neither centered around the\\n forward price nor are the probabilities symmetrical. Nonetheless, the expected\\n value for the underlying contract is still equal to $102\\n (6% × 83) + (15% × 90) + (39% × $99) + (33% × $110) + (7% × $123)\\n = 4.98 + 13.5 + 38.61 + 36.30 + 8.61 = $102\\n Using these probabilities, the theoretical value of the 100 call is\\n (33% × $10) + (7% × $23) 3.30 + 1.61 4.91\\n =\\n =\\n ≈ $4.81\\n 1.02\\n 1.02\\n 1.02\\n The forward price of the underlying contract plays a central role in all option pricing models. For European options, the current price of the underlying\\n contract is important only insofar as it can be turned into a forward price. Because of this, traders sometimes make the distinction between options that are\\n at the money (the exercise price is equal to the current underlying price) and\\n options which are at the forward (the exercise price is equal to the forward price\\n at expiration). In many markets, at-the-forward options are the most actively\\n traded, and such options are often used by traders as a benchmark for evaluating and trading other options.\\n Even if we assume an arbitrage-free market in the underlying contract, we\\n still have a major hurdle to overcome. In our simplified model, we assumed that\\n Figure 5-4\\n \\n 40%\\n \\n +1\\n +1\\n \\n 20%\\n \\n 20%\\n 10%\\n \\n 10%\\n \\n Underlying price:\\n \\n 82\\n \\n 92\\n \\n 102\\n \\n 112\\n \\n 122\\n \\n Value of 100 call:\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 2\\n \\n 12\\n \\n 22\\n \\n 60\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 60\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 5-5\\n \\n 39%\\n \\n +1\\n \\n 33%\\n +1\\n \\n 15%\\n 7%\\n \\n 6%\\n \\n Underlying price:\\n \\n 83\\n \\n 90\\n \\n 99\\n \\n 110\\n \\n 123\\n \\n Value of 100 call:\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 0\\n \\n 10\\n \\n 23\\n \\n there were only five possible price outcomes.

Lastly, depending on the option’s settlement procedure, calculate the\\n present value of the expected value.\\n \\n The Black-Scholes Model\\n One of the first attempts to describe traded options in detail was a pamphlet\\n written by Charles Castelli and published in London in 1877, “The Theory of\\n Options in Stocks and Shares.”4 This pamphlet included a description of some\\n commonly used hedging and trading strategies such as the “call-of-more” and the\\n “call-and-put.” Today, these strategies are known as a covered-write and a straddle.\\n The origins of modern option pricing theory are most often ascribed to the\\n year 1900, when French mathematician Louis Bachelier published The Theory\\n 4\\n \\n A photocopy of the Castelli pamphlet, which is now in the public domain, is available at books.google.com.\\n Theoretical Pricing Models\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 61\\n \\n 61\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cof Speculation, the first attempt to use higher mathematics to price option contracts.5 Although Bachelier’s treatise was an interesting academic study, it resulted in little practical application because there were no organized option\\n markets at that time. However, in 1973, concurrent with the opening of the\\n Chicago Board Options Exchange, Fischer Black, at the time associated with the\\n University of Chicago, and Myron Scholes, associated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, built on the work of Bachelier and other academics to introduce the first practical theoretical pricing model for options.6 The Black-Scholes\\n model,7 with its relatively simple arithmetic and limited number of inputs, most of\\n which were easily observable, proved an ideal tool for traders in the newly opened\\n U.S. option market. Although other models have subsequently been introduced to\\n overcome some of its original weaknesses, the Black-Scholes model remains the\\n most widely used of all option pricing models.\\n In its original form, the Black-Scholes model was intended to evaluate\\n European options (no early exercise permitted) on non-dividend-paying stocks.\\n Shortly after its introduction, realizing that many stocks pay dividends, Black\\n and Scholes added a dividend component. In 1976, Fischer Black made slight\\n modifications to the model to allow for the evaluation of options on futures\\n contracts.8 In 1983, Mark Garman and Steven Kohlhagen of the University of\\n California at Berkeley made additional modifications to allow for the evaluation of options on foreign currencies.9 The futures version and the foreign-currency version are known formally as the Black model and the Garman-Kohlhagen\\n model, respectively. However, the evaluation method in each variation, whether\\n the original Black-Scholes model for stock options, the Black model for futures\\n options, or the Garman-Kohlhagen model for foreign currency options, is so\\n similar that they have all come to be known simply as the Black-Scholes model.\\n The various forms of the model differ only in how they calculate the forward\\n price of the underlying contract and the settlement procedure for the options.\\n An option trader will simply choose the form appropriate to the options and\\n underlying instrument in which he is interested.\\n Given its widespread use and its importance in the development of other\\n pricing models, we will, for the moment, restrict ourselves to a discussion of\\n the Black-Scholes model and its various forms. In later chapters we will consider the question of early exercise. We will also look at alternative methods for\\n pricing options when we question some of the basic assumptions in the BlackScholes model.\\n See Louis Bachelier’s Theory of Speculation, Mark Davis and Alison Etheridge, trans.

The latter may be evaluated using the Black model for futures options.\\n 5\\n \\n 62\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 62\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cThe reasoning that led to the development of the Black-Scholes model is\\n similar to the simple approach we took earlier in this chapter for evaluating options. Black and Scholes worked originally with call values, but put values can\\n be derived in much the same way. Alternatively, we will see later that for European options there is a unique pricing relationship between an underlying contract and a call and put with the same exercise price and expiration date. This\\n relationship will enable us to derive a put value from the companion call value\\n or a call value from the companion put value.\\n To calculate an option’s theoretical value using the Black-Scholes model,\\n we need to know, at a minimum, five characteristics of the option and its underlying contract:\\n 1. The option’s exercise price\\n 2. The time remaining to expiration\\n 3. The current price of the underlying contract\\n 4. The applicable interest rate over the life of the option\\n 5. The volatility of the underlying contract\\n The last input, volatility, may be unfamiliar to a new trader. While we will\\n put off a detailed discussion of this input to Chapter 6, from our previous discussion, we can reasonably infer that volatility is related to either the speed of\\n the underlying market or the probabilities of different price outcomes.\\n If we know each of the required inputs, we can feed them into the theoretical pricing model and thereby generate a theoretical value (see Figure 5-6).\\n Black and Scholes also incorporated into their model the concept of a riskless hedge. For every option position, there is a theoretically equivalent position\\n in the underlying contract such that, for small price changes in the underlying\\n contract, the option position will gain or lose value at exactly the same rate as\\n the underlying position. To take advantage of a theoretically mispriced option,\\n Figure 5-6\\n \\n Exercise price\\n Time to expiration\\n Underlying price\\n \\n Pricing\\n model\\n \\n Theoretical\\n value\\n \\n Interest rate\\n Volatility\\n \\n Theoretical Pricing Models\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 63\\n \\n 63\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cit is necessary to establish this riskless hedge by offsetting the option position\\n with a theoretically equivalent underlying position. That is, whatever option\\n position we take, we must take an opposing market position in the underlying\\n contract. The correct proportion of underlying contracts needed to establish\\n this riskless hedge is determined by the option’s hedge ratio.\\n Why is it necessary to establish a riskless hedge? Recall that in our simplified approach, an option’s theoretical value depended on the probability of\\n various price outcomes for the underlying contract. As the price of the underlying contract changes, the probability of each outcome will also change. If the\\n underlying price is currently $100 and we assign a 25 percent probability to\\n $120, we might drop the probability for $120 to 10 percent if the price of the\\n underlying contract falls to $90. By initially establishing a riskless hedge and\\n then adjusting the hedge as market conditions change, we are taking into consideration these changing probabilities.\\n In this sense, an option can be thought of as a substitute for a position in\\n the underlying contract. A call is a substitute for a long position; a put is a substitute for a short position. Whether the substitute position is better than an\\n outright position in the underlying contract depends on the theoretical value\\n of the option compared with its price in the marketplace. If a call can be purchased for less than its theoretical value or a put can be sold for more than its\\n value, in the long run, it will be more profitable to take a long market position\\n by purchasing calls or selling puts than by purchasing the underlying contract.\\n In the same way, if a put can be purchased for less than its theoretical value or\\n a call can be sold for more than its value, in the long run, it will be more profitable to take a short market position by purchasing puts or selling calls than by\\n selling the underlying contract.\\n In later chapters we will discuss the concept of a riskless hedge in greater\\n detail. For now, we simply summarize the four basic option positions, their corresponding market positions, and the appropriate hedges:\\n Option Position\\n \\n Corresponding Market Position\\n \\n Appropriate Hedge\\n \\n Buy call(s)\\n \\n Long\\n \\n Sell underlying\\n \\n Sell call(s)\\n \\n Short\\n \\n Buy underlying\\n \\n Buy put(s)\\n \\n Short\\n \\n Buy underlying\\n \\n Sell put(s)\\n \\n Long\\n \\n Sell underlying\\n \\n For new traders, it may be helpful to point out that we are always doing\\n the opposite with calls and the underlying (i.e., buy calls, sell the underlying;\\n sell calls, buy the underlying) and doing the same with puts and the underlying\\n (i.e., buy puts, buy the underlying; sell puts, sell the underlying). Especially with\\n puts, more than a few new traders have initially done it backwards, buying puts\\n and selling the underlying or selling puts and buying the underlying. This, of\\n course, is no hedge at all.\\n Because the theoretical value obtained from a theoretical pricing model is\\n no better than the inputs into the model, a few comments on each of the inputs\\n will be worthwhile.\\n 64\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 64\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cExercise Price\\n There should never be any doubt about the exercise price of an option because\\n it is fixed under the terms of the contract and does not vary over the life of the\\n option.10 A March 60 call cannot suddenly turn into a March 55 call. A September 100 put cannot turn into a September 110 put.\\n \\n Time to Expiration\\n As with the exercise price, an option’s expiration date is fixed and will not vary.\\n A March 60 call will not suddenly turn into an April 60 call, nor will a September 100 put turn into an August 100 put. Of course, each day that passes brings\\n us closer to expiration, so in this sense the time to expiration is constantly growing shorter. However, the expiration date, like the exercise price, is fixed by the\\n exchange and will not change.\\n In financial models, one year is typically the standard unit of time.\\n Therefore, time to expiration is entered into the Black-Scholes model as an\\n annualized number. If we express time in terms of days, we must make the\\n appropriate adjustment by dividing the number of days to expiration by 365.\\n However, most option-evaluation computer programs already have this transformation incorporated into the software, so we need only enter the correct\\n number of days remaining to expiration.\\n It may seem that we have a problem in deciding what number of days to\\n enter into the model. We need the amount of time remaining to expiration\\n for two purposes: (1) to determine the likelihood of price movement in the\\n underlying contract and (2) to make interest calculations. For the former, we\\n are only interested in days on which the price of the underlying contract can\\n change. For exchange-traded contracts, this can only occur on business days.\\n This might lead us to drop weekends and holidays from our calculations. On\\n the other hand, for interest-rate purposes, we must include every day. If we\\n borrow or lend money, we expect interest to accrue every day, no matter that\\n some of those days are not business days.\\n However, this is not really a problem. In determining the likelihood of\\n price movement in the underlying contract, we observe only business days\\n because these are the only days on which price changes can occur. Then we\\n scale these values to an annualized number before feeding it into the theoretical pricing model. The result is that we can feed into our model the actual number of days remaining to expiration, knowing that the model will\\n interpret all inputs correctly.\\n Although traders typically express time to expiration in days, a trader may\\n want to use a different measure. Especially as expiration approaches, a trader\\n may prefer to use hours or even minutes. In theory, finer time increments should\\n yield more accurate values. But there is a practical limitation to using very small\\n increments of time. As time passes, the discrete increments of time we feed into\\n a theoretical pricing model may not accurately represent the continuous passage\\n An exchange may adjust the exercise price of a stock option as the result of a stock split or in the case of an\\n extraordinary dividend. In practical terms, this is only an accounting change. The characteristics of the option\\n contract remain essentially unchanged.\\n 10\\n \\n Theoretical Pricing Models\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 65\\n \\n 65\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cof time in the real world. Most traders have learned through experience that as\\n expiration approaches, the use of a theoretical pricing model becomes less reliable because the inputs become less reliable. Indeed, very close to expiration,\\n many traders stop using model-generated values altogether.\\n \\n Underlying Price\\n Unlike the exercise price and time to expiration, the correct price of the underlying contract is not always obvious. At any one time, there is a bid price and\\n an ask price (the bid-ask spread), and it may not be clear whether we ought to use\\n one or the other of these prices or perhaps some price in between.\\n Consider an underlying market where the last trade price was 75.25 but\\n that is currently displaying the following bid-ask spread:\\n 75.20–75.40\\n If a trader is using a theoretical pricing model to evaluate options on this market,\\n what price should he feed into the model? One possibility is 72.25, the last trade\\n price. Another possibility might be 75.30, the midpoint of the bid-ask spread.\\n Even though we are focusing on the use of theoretical pricing models, we\\n should emphasize that there is no law that says a trader must make any decisions\\n based on or consistent with a theoretical pricing model. A trader can simply\\n buy or sell options and hope that the trade turns out favorably. But a disciplined\\n trader who uses a pricing model knows that he is required to hedge the option position by taking an opposing market position in the underlying contract.\\n Therefore, the underlying price that he feeds into the theoretical pricing model\\n ought to be the price at which he believes he can make the opposing trade. If\\n the trader intends to purchase calls or sell puts, both of which are long market\\n positions, he will hedge by selling the underlying contract. In this case, he will\\n want to use something close to the bid price because that is the price at which he\\n can probably sell the underlying. On the other hand, if the trader intends to sell\\n calls or buy puts, both of which are short market positions, he will hedge by purchasing the underlying contract. Now he will want to use something close to the\\n ask price because that is the price at which he can probably buy the underlying.\\n In practice, if the underlying market is very liquid, with a narrow bid-ask\\n spread and many contracts available at each price, a trader who must make a\\n quick decision may very well use a price close to the midpoint because that probably represents a reasonable estimate of where the underlying can be bought\\n or sold. But in an illiquid market, with a very wide bid-ask spread and only a few\\n contracts available at each price, the trader must give extra thought to the appropriate underlying price. In such a market, particularly if the prices are changing\\n rapidly, it may be difficult to execute even a small order at the quoted prices.\\n \\n Interest Rates\\n Because an option trade may result in either a cash credit or debit to a trader’s\\n account, the interest considerations resulting from this cash flow must also play\\n a role in option evaluation. This is a function of interest rates over the life of\\n the option.\\n 66\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 66\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cInterest rates play two roles in the theoretical evaluation of options. First,\\n they may affect the forward price of the underlying contract. If the underlying\\n contract is subject to stock-type settlement, as we raise interest rates, we raise\\n the forward price, increasing the value of calls and decreasing the value of puts.\\n Second, interest rates may affect the present value of the option. If the option is\\n subject to stock-type settlement, as we raise interest rates, we reduce the present\\n value of the option. Although interest rates may affect both the forward price\\n and the present value, in most cases, the same rate is applicable, and we need\\n only input one interest rate into the model. If, however, different rates are applicable, as would be the case with foreign-currency options (the foreign-currency\\n interest rate plays one role, and the domestic-currency interest rate plays a different role), the model will require the input of two interest rates. This is the\\n case with the Garman-Kohlhagen version of the Black-Scholes model.\\n What interest rate should a trader use when evaluating options? Textbooks\\n often suggest using the risk-free rate, the rate that applies to the most creditworthy\\n borrower. In most markets, the government is considered the most secure borrower of funds, so the yield on a government security with a maturity equivalent to the life of the option is the general benchmark. For a 60-day option\\n denominated in dollars, we might use the yield on a 60-day U.S. Treasury bill;\\n for a 180-day option, we might use the yield on a 180-day U.S. Treasury bill.\\n In practice, no individual can borrow or lend at the same rate as the government, so it seems unrealistic to use the risk-free rate. To determine a more\\n realistic rate, a trader might look to a freely traded market in interest-rate contracts. In this respect, traders often use either the London Interbank Offered Rate\\n (LIBOR)11 or the Eurocurrency markets to determine the applicable rate. For\\n dollar-denominated options, Eurodollar futures traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are often used to determine a benchmark interest rate.\\n The situation is further complicated by the fact that most traders do not borrow and lend at the same rate, so the correct interest rate will, in theory, depend\\n on whether the trade will create a credit or a debit. In the former case, the trader\\n will be interested in the borrowing rate; in the latter case, he will be interested in\\n the lending rate. However, among the inputs into the model—the underlying\\n price, time to expiration, interest rates, and volatility—interest rates tend to play\\n the least important role. Using a rate that “makes sense” is usually a reasonable\\n solution. Of course, for very large positions or for very long-term options, small\\n changes in the interest rate can have a large impact. But for most traders, getting\\n the interest rate exactly right is usually not a major consideration.\\n \\n Dividends\\n We did not list dividends as a model input in Figure 5-5 because they are only\\n a factor in the theoretical evaluation of stock options and then only if the stock\\n is expected to pay a dividend over the life of the option. In order to evaluate a\\n stock option, the model must accurately calculate the forward price for the stock.\\n The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the rate paid by the London banks on dollar deposits. As such, it reflects the free-market interest rate for dollars. LIBOR is the underlying for Eurodollar futures traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The value of these contracts at maturity is determined by the average three-month\\n LIBOR rate quoted by the largest London banks.\\n 11\\n \\n Theoretical Pricing Models\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 67\\n \\n 67\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0cThis requires us to estimate both the amount of the dividend and the date on\\n which the dividend will be paid. In practice, rather than using the date of dividend payment, an option trader is likely to focus on the ex-dividend date, the date\\n on which the stock is trading without the rights to the dividend. The exact dividend payment date is important in calculating the interest that can be earned on\\n the dividend payment and thereby calculating a more accurate forward price.\\n But for a trader ownership of the stock in order to receive the dividend is the primary consideration. A deeply in-the-money option may have many of the same\\n characteristics as stock, but only ownership of the stock carries with it the rights\\n to the dividend.\\n In the absence of other information, most traders assume that a company\\n is likely to continue its past dividend policy. If a company has been paying a\\n 75-cent dividend each quarter, it will probably continue to do so. However, until the company officially declares the dividend, this is not a certainty. A company may increase or reduce its dividend or omit it completely. If there is the\\n possibility of a change in a company’s dividend policy, a trader must consider\\n its impact on option values. Additionally, if the ex-dividend date is expected\\n just prior to expiration, a delay of several days will cause the ex-dividend date\\n to fall after expiration. For purposes of option evaluation, this is the same as\\n eliminating the dividend entirely. In such a situation, a trader will need to make\\n a special effort to ascertain the exact ex-dividend date.\\n \\n Volatility\\n Of all the inputs required for option evaluation, volatility is the most difficult\\n for traders to understand. At the same time, volatility often plays the most important role in actual trading decisions. Changes in our assumptions about\\n volatility can have a dramatic effect on an option’s value. And the manner in\\n which the marketplace assesses volatility can have an equally dramatic effect on\\n an option’s price. For these reasons, we will begin a detailed discussion of volatility in Chapter 6.\\n \\n 68\\tO P T ION\\n \\n 05-Natenberg_ch05.indd 68\\n \\n V OLA T ILI T Y AND P RICING\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:28 PM\\n \\n \\x0c6\\n Volatility\\n What is volatility, and why is it so important in option evaluation? The option\\n trader, like a trader in the underlying instrument, is interested in the direction\\n of the market. But unlike a trader in the underlying, an option trader is also\\n sensitive to the speed of the market. If the market for an underlying contract\\n fails to move at a sufficient speed, options on that contract will have less value\\n because of the reduced likelihood of the market going through an option’s\\n exercise price. In a sense, volatility is a measure of the speed of the market.\\n Markets that move slowly are low-volatility markets; markets that move quickly\\n are high-volatility markets.\\n One might guess intuitively that some markets are more volatile than\\n others. During 2008, the price of crude oil began the year at $99 per barrel,\\n reached a high of $144 per barrel in July, and finished the year at $45 per barrel. The price rose 58 percent and then dropped 69 percent. Yet few traders\\n could imagine a major stock index such as the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500\\n Index exhibiting similar fluctuations over a single year.\\n If we know whether a market will be relatively volatile or relatively quiet\\n and can convey this information to a theoretical pricing model, any evaluation\\n of options on that market will be more accurate than if we simply ignore volatility. Because option models are based on mathematical formulas, we will need\\n some method of quantifying this volatility component so that we can feed it\\n into the model in numerical form.\\n \\n Random Walks and Normal Distributions\\n Consider for a moment the pinball maze pictured in Figure 6-1. When a ball is\\n dropped into the maze at the top, it falls downward, pulled by gravity through\\n a series of nails. When the ball encounters each nail, there is a 50 percent\\n chance that the ball will move to the left and a 50 percent chance that it will\\n move to the right. The ball then falls down a level where it encounters another\\n nail. Finally, at the bottom of the maze, the ball falls into one of the troughs.\\n \\n 69\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 69\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 6-1 Random walk.\\n . .\\n . . .\\n . . . .\\n . . . . .\\n . . . . . .\\n Random\\n . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . .\\n walk\\n . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n \\n As the ball falls down through the maze, it follows a random walk. Once the\\n ball enters the maze, nothing can be done to artificially alter its course, nor can\\n one predict the path that the ball will follow through the maze.\\n As more balls are dropped into the maze, they might begin to form a distribution similar to that in Figure 6-2. Most of the balls tend to cluster near the\\n center of the maze, with a decreasing number of balls ending up in troughs\\n farther away from the center. If many balls are dropped into the maze, they will\\n begin to form a bell-shaped or normal distribution.\\n If an infinite number of balls were dropped into the maze, the resulting\\n distribution might be approximated by a normal distribution curve such as the one\\n overlaid on the distribution in Figure 6-2. Such a curve is symmetrical (if we flip\\n it from right to left, it looks the same), it has its peak in the center, and its tails\\n always move down and away from the center.\\n Normal distribution curves are used to describe the likely outcomes of\\n random events. For example, the curve in Figure 6-2 might also represent the\\n results of flipping a coin 15 times. Each outcome, or trough, represents the\\n number of heads that occur from each 15 flips. An outcome in trough 0 represents 0 heads and 15 tails; an outcome in trough 15 represents 15 heads and 0\\n tails. Of course, we would be surprised to flip a coin 15 times and get all heads\\n or all tails. Assuming that the coin is perfectly balanced, some outcome in between, perhaps 8 heads and 7 tails, or 9 heads and 6 tails, seems more likely.\\n Suppose that we rearrange the nails in our maze so that each time a ball\\n encounters a nail and moves either left or right, it must drop down two levels\\n before it encounters another nail. If we drop enough balls into the maze, we\\n may end up with a distribution similar to the curve in Figure 6-3. Because the\\n 70\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 70\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 6-2 Normal distribution.\\n . .\\n . . .\\n . . . .\\n . . . . .\\n Normal\\n . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . .\\n distribution\\n . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\n \\n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\\n \\n Figure 6-3\\n \\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 71\\n \\n 71\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0csideways movement of the balls is restricted, the curve will have a higher peak\\n and narrower tails than the curve in Figure 6-2. In spite of its altered shape, the\\n distribution is still normal, although one with slightly different characteristics.\\n Finally, we might again rearrange the nails so that each time a ball drops\\n down a level, it must move two nails left or right before it can drop down to a\\n new level. If we drop enough balls into the maze, we may get a distribution that\\n resembles the curve in Figure 6-4. This distribution, although still normal, will\\n have a much lower peak and spread out much more quickly than the distributions in either Figure 6-2 or Figure 6-3.1\\n Suppose that we now think of the ball’s sideways movement as the up\\n and down price movement of an underlying contract and the ball’s downward\\n movement as the passage of time. If the price movement of an underlying\\n contract follows a random walk, the curves in Figures 6-2 through 6-4 might\\n represent possible price distributions in a moderate-, low-, and high-volatility\\n market, respectively.\\n Earlier in this chapter we suggested that the theoretical pricing of options\\n begins by assigning probabilities to the various underlying prices. How should\\n these probabilities be assigned? One possibility is to assume that, at expiration, the\\n underlying prices are normally distributed. Given that there are many different\\n normal distributions, how will our choice of distribution affect option evaluation?\\n Because all normal distributions are symmetrical, it may seem that the choice\\n of distribution is irrelevant. Increased volatility may increase the likelihood of\\n large upward movement, but this should be offset by the greater likelihood of\\n large downward movement. However, there is an important distinction between\\n Figure 6-4\\n \\n The pinball maze, or quincunx (sometimes also called a Galton board), pictured in these examples is often used to\\n demonstrate basic probability theory. Examples of a quincunx in action can be found at the following websites:\\n http://www.teacherlink.org/content/math/interactive/flash/quincunx/quincunx.html\\n http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/quincunx.html\\n http://www.jcu.edu/math/isep/Quincunx/Quincunx.html\\n 1\\n \\n 72\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 6-5\\n \\n Low-volatility\\n distribution\\n \\n Current\\n underlying\\n price\\n \\n Moderate-volatility\\n distribution\\n Exercise\\n price\\n \\n High-volatility\\n distribution\\n \\n Call value\\n \\n Price distribution at expiration\\n \\n an option position and an underlying position. The expected value for an underlying contract depends on all possible price outcomes. The expected value for\\n an option depends only on the outcomes that result in the option finishing in the\\n money. Everything else is zero.\\n In Figure 6-5, we have three possible price distributions centered around\\n the current price of an underlying contract. Suppose that we want to evaluate a call at a higher exercise price. The value of the call will depend on the\\n amount of the distribution to the right of the exercise price. We can see that as\\n we move from a low-volatility distribution, to a moderate-volatility distribution,\\n to a high-volatility distribution, a greater portion of the possible price distribution lies to the right of the exercise price. Consequently, the option takes on an\\n increasingly greater value.\\n We might also consider the value of a put at a lower exercise price. If we\\n assume that movement is random, the same high-volatility distribution that will\\n cause the call to take on greater value will also cause the put to take on greater\\n value. In the case of the put, more of the distribution will lie to the left of the\\n exercise price. Because our distributions are symmetrical, in a high-volatility\\n market, all options, whether calls or puts, higher or lower exercise prices, take\\n on greater value. For the same reason, in a low-volatility market, all options\\n take on reduced values.\\n \\n Mean and Standard Deviation\\n If we assume a normal distribution of prices, we will need a method of describing the appropriate normal distribution to the theoretical pricing\\n model. Fortunately, all normal distributions can be fully described with two\\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 73\\n \\n 73\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cnumbers—the mean and the standard deviation. If we know that a distribution is\\n normal, and we also know the mean and standard deviation, then we know all\\n the characteristics of the distribution.\\n Graphically, we can interpret the mean as the location of the peak of the\\n distribution and the standard deviation as a measure of how fast the distribution spreads out. Distributions that spread out very quickly, such as the one in\\n Figure 6-4, have a high standard deviation. Distributions that spread out very\\n slowly, such as the one in Figure 6-3, have a low standard deviation.\\n Numerically, the mean is simply the average outcome, a concept familiar\\n to most traders. To calculate the mean, we add up all the results and divide by\\n the total number of occurrences. Calculation of the standard deviation is not\\n quite so simple and will be discussed later. What is important at this point is\\n the interpretation of these numbers, in particular, what a mean and standard\\n deviation suggest in terms of likely price movement.\\n Let’s go back to Figure 6-2 and consider the troughs numbered 0 to 15 at\\n the bottom. We suggested that these numbers might represent the number of\\n heads resulting from 15 flips of a coin. Alternatively, they might represent the\\n number of times a ball goes to the right at each nail as it drops down through\\n the maze. The first trough is assigned 0 because any ball that ends there must\\n go left at every nail. The last trough is assigned 15 because any ball that ends\\n there must go right at every nail.\\n Suppose that we are told that the mean and standard deviation in Figure 6-2\\n are 7.50 and 3.00, respectively.2 What does this tell us about the distribution?\\n The mean tells us the average outcome. If we add up all the outcomes and\\n divide by the number of occurrences, the result will be 7.50. In terms of the\\n troughs, the average result will fall halfway between troughs 7 and 8. (Of course,\\n this is not an actual possibility. However, we noted in Chapter 5 that the average\\n outcome does not have to be an actual possibility for any one outcome.)\\n The standard deviation determines not only how fast the distribution\\n spreads out, but it also tells us something about the likelihood of a ball ending up in a specific trough or group of troughs. In particular, the standard deviation tells us the probability of a ball ending up in a trough that is a specified\\n distance from the mean. For example, we may want to know the likelihood of a\\n ball falling down through the maze and ending up in a trough lower than 5 or\\n higher than 10. The answer to this question depends on the number of standard\\n deviations the ball must move away from the mean. If we know this, we can determine the probability associated with that number of standard deviations.\\n The exact probability associated with any specific number of standard deviations can be found in most texts on statistics or probability. Alternatively,\\n such probabilities can be easily calculated in most commonly used computer\\n spreadsheet programs. For option traders, the following approximations will\\n be useful:\\n ±1 standard deviation takes in approximately 68.3 percent (about\\n 2/3) of all occurrences.\\n The reader who is familiar with the mean and standard deviation and who would like to check the arithmetic\\n will find that the actual mean and standard deviation are 7.49 and 3.02. For simplicity, we have rounded these to\\n 7.50 and 3.00.\\n 2\\n \\n 74\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 74\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0c±2 standard deviations takes in approximately 95.4 percent (about\\n 19/20) of all occurrences.\\n ±3 standard deviations takes in approximately 99.7 percent (about\\n 369/370) of all occurrences.\\n Note that each number of standard deviations is preceded by a plus or\\n minus sign. Because normal distributions are symmetrical, the likelihood of\\n up movement and down movement is identical. The probability associated\\n with each number of standard deviations is usually given as a decimal value,\\n but a fractional approximation is often useful to traders, and this appears in\\n parentheses.\\n Now let’s try to answer our question about the likelihood of getting a\\n ball in a trough lower than 5 or higher than 10. We can designate the divider\\n between troughs 7 and 8 as the mean, 7½. If the standard deviation is 3, what\\n troughs are within one standard deviation of the mean? One standard deviation from the mean is 7½ ± 3, or 4½ to10½. Interpreting ½ as the divider\\n between troughs, we can see that troughs 5 through 10 fall within 1 standard\\n deviation of the mean. We know that one standard deviation takes in about\\n two-thirds of all occurrences, so we can conclude that out of every three balls\\n we drop into the maze, two should end up in troughs 5 through 10. Whatever is left over, one out of every three balls, will end up in one of the remaining troughs, 0 through 4 and 11 through 15. Hence, the answer to our\\n original question about the likelihood of getting a ball in a trough lower than\\n 5 or higher than 10 is about 1 chance in 3, or about 33 percent. (The exact\\n answer is 100% – 68.3% = 31.7%.) This is shown in Figure 6-6.\\n Let’s try another calculation, but this time we can think of the problem as a\\n wager. Suppose that someone offers us 30 to 1 odds against dropping a ball into\\n the maze and having it end up specifically in troughs 14 or 15. Is this bet worth\\n making? One characteristic of standard deviations is that they are additive. In\\n our example, if one standard deviation is 3, then two standard deviations are\\n 6. Two standard deviations from the mean is therefore 7½ ± 6, or 1½ to 13½.\\n We can see in Figure 6-6 that troughs 14 and 15 lie outside two standard deviations. Because the probability of getting a result within two standard deviations\\n is approximately 19 out of 20, the probability of getting a result beyond two\\n standard deviations is 1 chance in 20. Therefore, 30 to 1 odds may seem very\\n favorable. Recall, however, that beyond two standard deviations also includes\\n troughs 0 and 1. Because normal distributions are symmetrical, the chances of\\n getting a ball specifically in troughs 14 or 15 must be half of 1 chance in 20, or\\n about 1 chance in 40. At 30 to 1 odds, the bet must be a bad one because the\\n odds do not sufficiently compensate us for the risk involved.\\n In Chapter 5, we suggested that a truly accurate theoretical pricing model\\n would require us to assign probabilities to an infinite number of possible price\\n outcomes for an underlying contract. Then, if we multiply each price outcome\\n by its associated probability, we can use the results to calculate an option’s theoretical value. The problem is that an infinite number of anything is not easy to\\n work with. Fortunately, the characteristics of normal distributions are so well\\n known that formulas have been developed that facilitate the computation of\\n both the probabilities associated with every point along a normal distribution\\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 75\\n \\n 75\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 6-6\\n \\n mean = 7.50\\n standard deviation = 3.00\\n \\n ± 1 st. dev. = 68.3% (approx. 2/3)\\n ± 2 st. dev. = 95.4% (approx. 19/20)\\n ± 3 st. dev. = 99.7% (approx. 369/370)\\n 95%\\n \\n 68%\\n \\n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\\n –2\\n st. dev.\\n 1.50\\n \\n –1\\n st. dev.\\n 4.50\\n \\n mean\\n 7.50\\n \\n +1\\n st. dev.\\n 10.50\\n \\n +2\\n st. dev.\\n 13.50\\n \\n curve and the area under various portions of the curve. If we assume that prices\\n of an underlying instrument are normally distributed, these formulas represent\\n a unique set of tools to help us solve for an option’s theoretical value.\\n Louis Bachelier was the first to make the assumption that the prices of an\\n underlying contract are normally distributed. As we shall see, there are logical\\n problems with this assumption. Consequently, over the years, the assumption\\n has been modified to make it more consistent with real-world conditions. In its\\n modified form, it is the basis for many theoretical pricing models, including the\\n Black-Scholes model.\\n \\n Forward Price as the Mean of a Distribution\\n If we decide to assign probabilities that are consistent with a normal distribution, how do we feed this distribution into a theoretical pricing model? Because\\n all normal distributions can be described by a mean and a standard deviation,\\n in some way we must feed these two numbers into our pricing model.\\n In Chapter 5, we suggested that any distribution ought to be centered\\n around the most likely underlying price at expiration. Although we cannot\\n 76\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 76\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cknow exactly what that price will be, if we assume that no arbitrage opportunity exists in the underlying contract, a logical guess is the forward price. If we\\n make the assumption that the forward price represents the mean of a distribution, then in the long run, any trade made at the current underlying price will\\n just break even. The various forms of the Black-Scholes model differ primarily\\n in how they calculate the forward price. Depending on the type of underlying\\n contract, whether a stock, a futures contract, or a foreign currency, the model\\n takes the current underlying price, the time to expiration, interest rates, and, in\\n the case of stocks, dividends to calculate the forward price. It then makes this\\n the mean of the distribution.\\n \\n Volatility as a Standard Deviation\\n In addition to the mean, to fully describe a normal distribution, we also need\\n a standard deviation. When we input a volatility into a theoretical pricing\\n model, we are actually feeding in a standard deviation. Volatility is just a trader’s term for standard deviation. Because the Greek letter sigma (σ) is the\\n traditional notation for standard deviation, in this text we will use the same\\n notation for volatility.\\n At this point, it will help if we assign a working definition to volatility,\\n although we will later modify this definition slightly. For the present, we will assume that the volatility we feed into a pricing model represents a one standard\\n deviation price change, in percent, over a one-year period. For example, consider\\n a contract with a one-year forward price of 100 and that we are told has a volatility of 20 percent. (We’ll discuss later where this number might come from.) With\\n a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20 percent, if we come back one year\\n from now, there is a 68 percent probability that the contract will be trading between 80 and 120 (100 ± 20%), a 95 percent probability that the contract will be\\n trading between 60 and 140 (100 ± 2 × 20%), and a 99.7 percent probability that\\n the contract will be trading between 40 and 160 (100 ± 3 × 20%). These are the\\n probabilities associated with one, two, and three standard deviations.\\n Instead of specifying the forward price, suppose that we are dealing with\\n a stock that is currently trading at $100 and that has the same 20 percent\\n volatility. In order to determine the one-year probabilities, we must first determine the one-year forward price because this represents the mean of the\\n distribution. If interest rates are 8 percent and the stock pays no dividends,\\n the one-year forward price will be $108. Now, a one standard deviation price\\n change is 20% × $108 = $21.60. Thus, one year from now, we would expect\\n the same stock to be trading between $86.40 and $129.60 ($108 ± $21.60)\\n approximately 68 percent of the time, between $64.80 and $151.20 ($108 ±\\n 2 × $21.60) approximately 95 percent of the time, and between $43.20 and\\n $172.80 ($108 ± 3 × $21.60) approximately 99.7 percent of the time.\\n Returning to our contract with a forward price of 100, suppose that we\\n come back at the end of one year and find that the contract, which we thought\\n had a volatility of 20 percent, is trading at 35. Does this mean that the volatility of 20 percent was wrong? A price change of more than three standard deviations may be unlikely, but one should not confuse unlikely with impossible.\\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 77\\n \\n 77\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFlipping a perfectly balanced coin 15 times may result in 15 heads, even though\\n the odds of this occurring are less than one chance in 32,000. If 20 percent\\n is the right volatility, the probability that the price will fall from 100 to 35 in\\n one year is less than one chance in 1,500. However, one chance in 1,500 is not\\n impossible, and perhaps this was the one time in 1,500 when the price did indeed end up at 35. Of course, it is also possible that we had the wrong volatility. But we can’t make that determination without looking at a large number of\\n price changes for the contract so that we have a representative price distribution.\\n \\n Scaling Volatility for Time\\n Like interest rates, volatility is always expressed as an annualized number. If\\n someone says that interest rates are 6 percent, no one needs to ask whether that\\n means 6 percent per day, 6 percent per week, or 6 percent per month. Everyone\\n knows that it means 6 percent per year. The same is true of volatility.\\n We might logically ask what an annual volatility tells us about the likelihood of price changes over some shorter period of time. Although interest\\n rates are proportional to time (we simply multiply the rate by the amount of\\n time), volatility is proportional to the square root of time. To calculate a volatility, or standard deviation, over some period of time other than one year, we\\n must multiply the annual volatility be the square root of time, where the time\\n period t is expressed in years\\n Volatility t = volatility annual × t\\n Traders typically calculate volatility for an underlying contract by observing\\n price changes at regular intervals. Let’s begin by assuming that we plan to\\n observe price changes at the end of every day. Because there are 365 days\\n in a year, it might seem that prices can change 365 times per year. In this\\n text, though, we are focusing primarily on exchange-traded contracts. Because\\n most exchanges are closed on weekends and holidays, if we observe the price\\n of an underlying contract at the end of every day, prices cannot really change\\n 365 times per year. Depending on the exchange, there are probably somewhere between 250 and 260 trading days in a year.3 Because we need the\\n square root of the number of trading days, for convenience, many traders\\n assume that there are 256 trading days in a year given that the square root of\\n 256 is a whole number, 16. If we make this assumption, then\\n Volatility daily = volatility annual × 1/ 256 = volatility annual × 1/16 =\\n \\n volatility annual\\n 16\\n \\n To approximate a daily standard deviation, we can divide the annual volatility by 16.\\n Returning to our contract trading at 100 with a volatility of 20 percent,\\n what is a one standard deviation price change from one day to the next?\\n As markets around the world become more integrated, and with the advent of electronic trading, it may\\n become more difficult to determine exactly what fraction of a year one day represents. Depending on the\\n contract and exchange, in some cases it may be sensible to look at prices every day, 365 days per year.\\n 3\\n \\n 78\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 78\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cThe answer is 20%/16 = 1¼%, so a one standard deviation daily price\\n change is 1¼% × 100 = 1.25. We expect to see a price change of 1.25 or less\\n approximately two trading days out of every three and a price change of 2.50\\n or less approximately 19 trading days out of every 20. Only one day in 20\\n would we expect to see a price change of more than 2.50.\\n We can do the same type of calculation for a weekly standard deviation.\\n Now we must ask how many times per year prices can change if we look at\\n prices once a week. There are no complete weeks when no trading takes place,\\n so we must make our calculations using all 52 trading weeks in a year. Therefore,\\n Volatility weekly = volatility annual × 1/ 52 ≈ volatility annual × 1/7.2 =\\n \\n volatility annual\\n 7.2\\n \\n To approximate a weekly standard deviation, we can divide the annual\\n volatility by 7.2. Dividing our annual volatility of 20 percent by the square\\n root of 52, or approximately 7.2, we get 20%/7.2 » 2.78. For our contract\\n trading at 100, we would expect to see a price change of 2.78 or less two weeks\\n out of every three, a price change of 5.56 or less 19 weeks out of every 20, and\\n only one week in 20 would we expect to see a price change of more than 5.56.\\n If we want to be as accurate as possible, when estimating a daily or weekly\\n standard deviation, we ought to begin by calculating the one-day or one-week\\n forward price. But for short periods of time, the forward price is so close to the\\n current price that most traders assume for convenience that a one-day or oneweek distribution is centered around the current price.\\n Suppose that a stock is trading at $45 per share and has an annual volatility\\n of 37 percent. What is an approximate one and two standard deviation price\\n range from one day to the next and from one week to the next? For one day, we\\n can divide the annual volatility by 16 (the square root of 256, the number of\\n trading days in a year)\\n $45 ×\\n \\n 37%\\n ≈ $1.04\\n 16\\n \\n A one and two standard deviation daily price range is approximately\\n $45 ± $1.04 ≈ $43.96 to $46.04 (one standard deviation)\\n $45 ± (2 × $1.04) ≈ $42.92 to $47.08 (two standard deviations)\\n For one week, we can divide the annual volatility by 7.2 (the square root of 52,\\n the number of trading weeks in a year)\\n 37%\\n = $2.31\\n 7.2\\n A one and two standard deviation weekly price range is approximately\\n $45 ×\\n \\n $45 ± $2.31 ≈ $42.69 to $47.31\\n $45 ± (2 × $2.31) ≈ $40.38 to $49.62\\n \\n (one standard deviation)\\n (two standard deviations)\\n \\n When we scale volatility for time, the same probabilities still apply. Approximately\\n 68 percent of the occurrences will fall within one standard deviation. Approximately 95 percent of the occurrences will fall within two standard deviations.\\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 79\\n \\n 79\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cVolatility and Observed Price Changes\\n Why might a trader want to estimate daily or weekly price changes from an\\n annual volatility? Volatility is the one input into a theoretical pricing model\\n that cannot be directly observed. Yet many option strategies, if they are to\\n be successful, require a reasonable assessment of volatility. Therefore, an\\n option trader needs some method of determining whether his expectations\\n about volatility are being realized in the marketplace. Unlike directional strategies, whose success or failure can be immediately observed from current prices,\\n there is no such thing as a current volatility. A trader must usually determine\\n for himself whether he is using a reasonable volatility input into the theoretical pricing model.\\n Previously, we estimated that for a $45 stock with an annual volatility of\\n 37 percent, a one standard deviation price change is approximately $1.04. Suppose that over five days we observe the following daily settlement price changes:\\n +$0.98,\\n \\n –$0.65,\\n \\n –$0.70,\\n \\n +$0.25,\\n \\n –$0.85\\n \\n Are these price changes consistent with a 37 percent volatility?\\n We expect to see a price change of more than $1.04 (one standard deviation) about one day in three. Over five days, we would expect to see at least\\n one day, and perhaps two days, with a price change greater than one standard deviation. Yet, during this five-day period, we did not see a price change\\n greater than $1.04 even once. What conclusions can be drawn from this? One\\n thing seems clear: these five price changes do not appear to be consistent with\\n a 37 percent volatility.\\n Before making any decisions, we ought to consider any unusual conditions\\n that might be affecting the observed price changes. Perhaps this was a holiday\\n week, and as such, it did not reflect normal market activity. If this is our conclusion, then 37 percent may still be a reasonable volatility estimate. On the other\\n hand, if we can see no logical reason for the market being less volatile than\\n predicted by a 37 percent volatility, then we may simply be using the wrong\\n volatility. If we come to this conclusion, perhaps we ought to consider using a\\n lower volatility that is more consistent with the observed price changes. If we\\n continue to use a volatility that is not consistent with the actual price changes,\\n then we have the wrong volatility. If we have the wrong volatility, we have the\\n wrong probabilities. And if we have the wrong probabilities, we are generating\\n incorrect theoretical values, thereby defeating the purpose of using a theoretical pricing model in the first place.\\n Admittedly, five days is a very small number of price changes, and it is\\n unlikely that a trader will rely heavily on such a small sample. If we flip a coin\\n five times and it comes up heads each time, we may not be able to draw any\\n definitive conclusions. But if we flip the coin 50 times and it comes up heads\\n every time, now we might conclude that there is something wrong with the\\n coin. In the same way, most traders prefer to see larger price samplings, perhaps 20 days, or 50 days, or 100 days, before drawing any dramatic conclusions about volatility.\\n Exactly what volatility is associated with the five price changes in the foregoing example? Without doing some rather involved arithmetic, it is difficult to say.\\n 80\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 80\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0c(The answer is actually 27.8 percent.) However, if a trader has some idea of the\\n price changes he expects, he can easily see that the changes over the five-day\\n period are not consistent with a 37 percent volatility.4\\n We have used the phrase price change in conjunction with our volatility estimates. Exactly what do we mean by this? Do we mean the high/low during some\\n period? Do we mean open-to-close price changes? Or is there another interpretation? Although various methods have been suggested to estimate volatility, the\\n most common method for exchange-traded contracts has been to calculate volatility based on settlement-to-settlement price changes. Using this approach, when\\n we say that a one standard deviation daily price change is $1.04, we mean $1.04\\n from one day’s settlement price to the next day’s settlement price. The high/low\\n or open/close price range may have been either more or less than this amount,\\n but it is the settlement-to-settlement price change on which we focus.5\\n \\n A Note on Interest-Rate Products\\n For some interest-rate products, primarily Eurocurrency interest-rate futures,\\n the listed contract price represents the interest rate associated with that contract, expressed as a whole number, subtracted from 100.6 If the London\\n Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the interest paid on dollar deposits outside\\n the United States, is 7.00 percent, the associated Eurodollar futures contract\\n traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will be trading at 100 – 7.00 =\\n 93.00. If Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), the interest paid on euro deposits outside the European Economic Union, is 4.50 percent, the associated\\n Euribor futures contract traded at the London International Financial Futures\\n Exchange will be trading at 100 – 4.50 = 95.50. Volatility calculations for these\\n contracts are done using the rate associated with the contract (the rate volatility)\\n rather than the price of the contract (the price volatility).\\n If a Eurodollar futures contract is trading at 93.00 with a volatility of\\n 26 percent, an approximate daily and weekly one standard deviation price\\n change is\\n (100 − 93) ×\\n \\n 26%\\n ≈ 0.11\\n 16\\n \\n (daily standard deviation)\\n \\n (100 − 93) ×\\n \\n 26%\\n ≈ 0.25\\n 7.2\\n \\n (weekly standard deviation)\\n \\n A price change greater than two standard deviations will occur about 1 time in 20. Because there are approximately 20 trading days in a month, as an additional benchmark, most traders expect to see a daily two standard\\n deviation occurrence about once a month.\\n 5\\n Alternative methods of estimating volatility have also been proposed when trading is continuous or when\\n there is no well-defined daily settlement price. See, for example, Michael Parkinson, “The Extreme Value\\n Method of Estimating the Variance of the Rate of Return,” Journal of Business 53(1):61–64, 1980; Mark B.\\n Garman and Michael J. Klass, “On the Estimation of Security Price Volatilities from Historical Data,” Journal\\n of Business 53(1):67–78, 1980; and Stan Beckers, “Variance of Security Price Returns Based on High, Low, and\\n Closing Prices,” Journal of Business 56(1):97–112, 1983.\\n 6\\n This method of quoting Eurocurrency contracts is used so that moves in Eurocurrency contracts will tend to\\n mimic moves in bond prices. If interest rates rise, both bond prices and Eurocurrency futures will fall; if interest\\n rates fall, both bond prices and Eurocurrency futures will rise.\\n 4\\n \\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 81\\n \\n 81\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cTo be consistent, if we index Eurodollar futures prices from 100, we must\\n also index exercise prices from 100. Therefore, a 93.00 exercise price in our\\n pricing model is really a 7.00 percent (100 – 93.00) exercise price. This transformation also requires us to reverse the type of option, changing calls to puts\\n and puts to calls. To see why, consider a 93.00 call. For this call to go into the\\n money, the underlying contract must rise above 93.00. But this requires that\\n interest rates fall below 7.00 percent. Therefore, a 93.00 call in listed terms is\\n the same as a 7.00 percent put in interest-rate terms. A model that is correctly\\n set up to evaluate options on Eurodollar or other types of indexed interest-rate\\n contracts will make this transformation automatically. The price of the underlying contract and the exercise price are subtracted from 100, with listed calls\\n treated as puts and listed puts treated as calls.\\n This type of transformation is not required for most bonds and notes.\\n Depending on the coupon rate, the prices of these products may range freely\\n without upper limit, often exceeding 100. Exchange-traded options on bond\\n and note futures are therefore most often evaluated using a traditional pricing\\n model. However, interest-rate products present other problems that may require specialized pricing models.\\n It is possible to take an instrument such as a bond and calculate the current\\n yield based on its price in the marketplace. If we were to take a series of bond\\n prices and from these calculate a series of yields, we could calculate the yield volatility, that is, the volatility based on the change in yield. We might then use this\\n number to evaluate the theoretical value of an option on the bond, although to\\n be consistent we would also have to specify the exercise price in terms of yield.\\n Because it is possible to calculate the volatility of an interest-rate product using these two different methods, interest-rate traders usually make a distinction\\n between yield volatility (the volatility calculated from the current yield on the\\n instrument) and price volatility (the volatility calculated from the price of the\\n instrument in the marketplace).\\n \\n Lognormal Distributions\\n Thus far we have assumed that the prices of an underlying instrument are normally distributed. Is this a reasonable assumption? Beyond the question of the\\n exact distribution of prices in the real world, the normal distribution assumption has one serious flaw. A normal distribution is symmetrical. For every possible upward move in the price of an underlying instrument, there must be the\\n possibility of a downward move of equal magnitude. If we allow for the possibility of a $50 contract rising $75 to $125, we also must allow for the possibility\\n of the contract dropping $75 to a price of –$25. But negative prices are clearly\\n not possible for traditional stocks or commodities.\\n We have defined volatility in terms of the percent changes in the price of\\n an underlying instrument. In this sense, an interest rate and volatility are similar in that they both represent a rate of return. The primary difference between\\n interest and volatility is that interest accrues only at a positive rate, whereas\\n volatility is a combination of positive and negative rates of return. If we invest money at a fixed interest rate, the value of the principal will always grow.\\n 82\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 82\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cHowever, if we invest in an underlying instrument with a volatility other than\\n zero, the instrument may go up or down in price, resulting in either a profit (a\\n positive rate of return) or a loss (a negative rate of return).\\n A rate-of-return calculation must specify not only the rate that is being\\n used but also the time intervals over which the returns are calculated. Suppose\\n that we invest $1,000 for one year at an annual interest rate of 12 percent.\\n How much will we have at the end of one year? The answer depends on how\\n the 12 percent interest on our investment is paid out.\\n Rate of Payment\\n \\n Value after One Year\\n \\n Total Yield\\n \\n 12% once a year\\n \\n $1,120.00\\n \\n 12.00%\\n \\n 6% twice a year\\n \\n $1,123.60\\n \\n 12.36%\\n \\n 3% every three months\\n \\n $1,125.51\\n \\n 12.55%\\n \\n 1% every month\\n \\n $1,126.83\\n \\n 12.68%\\n \\n 12%/52 every week\\n \\n $1,127.34\\n \\n 12.73%\\n \\n 12%/365 every day\\n \\n $1,127.47\\n \\n 12.75%\\n \\n 12% compounded continuously\\n \\n $1,127.50\\n \\n 12.75%\\n \\n As interest is paid more frequently, even though it is paid at the same rate\\n of 12 percent per year, the total yield on the investment increases. The yield is\\n greatest when interest is paid continuously. In this case, it is just as if interest is\\n paid at every possible moment in time.\\n Although less common, we can do the same type of calculation using a\\n negative interest rate. For example, suppose that we make a bad investment of\\n $1,000 and lose money at a rate of 12 percent annually (interest rate = –12%).\\n How much will we have at the end of a year? The answer, again, depends on\\n the frequency at which our losses accrue.\\n Rate of Payment\\n \\n Value after One Year\\n \\n Total Yield\\n \\n –12% once a year\\n \\n $880.00\\n \\n –12.00%\\n \\n –6% twice a year\\n \\n $883.60\\n \\n –11.64%\\n \\n –3% every three months\\n \\n $885.29\\n \\n –11.47%\\n \\n –1% every month\\n \\n $886.38\\n \\n –11.36%\\n \\n –12%/52 every week\\n \\n $886.80\\n \\n –11.32%\\n \\n –12%/365 every day\\n \\n $886.90\\n \\n –11.31%\\n \\n –12% compounded continuously\\n \\n $886.92\\n \\n –11.31%\\n \\n In the case of a negative interest rate, as losses are compounded more frequently, even though at the same rate of –12 percent per year, the smaller the\\n total loss, and consequently, the smaller the negative yield.\\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 83\\n \\n 83\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cIn the same way that interest can be compounded at different intervals,\\n volatility can also be compounded at different intervals. The Black-Scholes\\n model is a continuous-time model. The model assumes that volatility is compounded continuously, just as if the price changes in the underlying contract,\\n either up or down, are taking place continuously but at an annual rate corresponding to the volatility associated with the contract. When the percent price\\n changes are normally distributed, the continuous compounding of these price\\n changes will result in a lognormal distribution of prices at expiration. Such a distribution is shown in Figure 6-7. The entire distribution is skewed toward the\\n upside because upside price changes (a positive rate of return) will be greater,\\n in absolute terms, than downside price changes (a negative rate of return).\\n In our interest-rate example, a continuously compounded rate of return of\\n +12 percent yields a profit of $127.50 after one year, whereas a continuously\\n compounded rate of return of –12 percent yields a loss of only $113.08. If the\\n 12 percent is a volatility, then a one standard deviation upward price change at\\n the end of one year is +$127.50, whereas a one standard deviation downward\\n price change is –$113.08. Even though the rate of return is a constant 12 percent, the continuous compounding of 12 percent yields different upward and\\n downward moves.\\n Note also the location of the mean of the distributions in Figure 6-7. The\\n mean can be thought of as the “balance point” of the distribution. For a normal distribution, the peak of the distribution, or mode, and the mean have the\\n same location, exactly in the middle of the distribution. But in a lognormal\\n distribution the right tail, which is open-ended, is longer than the left tail,\\n which is bounded by zero. Because there is more “weight” to the right of the\\n peak, the mean of the lognormal distribution must be located to the right of\\n the peak.\\n \\n Figure 6-7\\n \\n Normal\\n distribution\\n \\n Lognormal\\n distribution\\n Normal\\n mean\\n \\n 0\\n \\n –∞\\n \\n 84\\n \\n Lognormal\\n mean\\n \\n Price distribution\\n at expiration\\n \\n +∞\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 84\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cContinuous rates of return can be calculated using the exponential\\n function,7 denoted by either exp(x) or ex. In the preceding examples,\\n $1,000 × e0.12 = $1,127.50\\n \\n and\\n \\n $1,000 × e–0.12 = $886.92\\n \\n No matter how large the negative interest rate, continuous compounding\\n precludes the possibility of an investment falling below zero because it is impossible to lose more than 100 percent of an investment. Consequently, in a lognormal distribution, the value of the underlying instrument is bounded by zero\\n on the downside. Clearly, this is a more realistic representation of the real world\\n than a normal distribution.\\n We can see the effect of using a lognormal distribution rather than a normal\\n distribution by considering the value of a 90 put and 110 call with a forward price\\n of 100 for the underlying contract with six months to expiration and a volatility\\n of 30 percent\\n Contract\\n \\n Value if Price Distribution\\n Is Normal\\n \\n Value if Price Distribution\\n Is Lognormal\\n \\n 90 put\\n \\n 4.37\\n \\n 4.00\\n \\n 110 call\\n \\n 4.37\\n \\n 4.74\\n \\n Under a normal distribution assumption, both the call and put have\\n exactly the same value because they are both 10 percent out of the money. But\\n under the lognormal distribution assumption in the Black-Scholes model, the\\n 110 call will always have a greater value than the 90 put. The value of the 110\\n call can potentially appreciate without limit because the price of the underlying contract has no limit on the upside. The 90 put, however, can only rise to a\\n maximum value of 90 because the price of the underlying contract can never\\n fall below zero.\\n Of course, the values in the preceding example are true only in theory.\\n There is no law that prevents the 90 put from trading at a price greater than the\\n 110 call. Indeed, such price relationships occur in many markets for a variety\\n of reasons that we will discuss later. However, one possible explanation is that\\n the marketplace disagrees with the assumptions on which the model is based.\\n Perhaps the marketplace believes that a lognormal distribution is not an accurate representation of possible prices. And perhaps the marketplace is right!\\n \\n Interpreting Volatility Data\\n When traders discuss volatility, even experienced traders may find that they are\\n not always talking about the same thing. When a trader says that the volatility\\n is 25 percent, this statement may take on a variety of meanings. We can avoid\\n confusion in subsequent discussions if we define some of the different ways in\\n It will be useful for an option trader to become familiar with the characteristics of the exponential function\\n [ex or exp(x)] and its inverse, the logarithmic function [ln(x)]. These can be found in any algebra or finance text.\\n 7\\n \\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 85\\n \\n 85\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cwhich traders refer to volatility. We can begin by dividing volatility into two categories—realized volatility, which we associate with an underlying contract, and\\n implied volatility, which we associate with options.\\n \\n Realized Volatility\\n The realized volatility is the annualized standard deviation of percent price\\n changes of an underlying contract over some period of time.8 When we calculate realized volatility, we must specify both the interval at which we are\\n measuring the price changes and the number of intervals to be used in the calculations. For example, we might talk about the 50-day volatility of an underlying contract. Or we might talk about the 52-week volatility of a contract. In\\n the former case, we are calculating the volatility from the daily price changes\\n over a 50-day period.9 In the latter case, we are calculating the volatility from\\n the weekly price changes over a 52-week period.\\n On a graph of realized volatility, each point represents the volatility over a\\n specified period using price changes over a specified interval. If we graph the\\n 50-day volatility of a contract, each point on the graph represents the annualized standard deviation of the daily price changes over the previous 50 days. If\\n we graph the 52-week volatility, each point on the graph represents the annualized standard deviation of the weekly price changes over the previous 52 weeks.\\n Traders may also refer to realized volatility in the future (future realized volatility) and realized volatility in the past (historical realized volatility). The future\\n realized volatility is what every trader would like to know—the volatility that\\n best describes the future distribution of price changes for an underlying contract. In theory, it is the future realized volatility over the life of the option that\\n we need to input into a theoretical pricing model. If a trader knows the future\\n realized volatility, he knows the right “odds.” When he feeds this number into a\\n theoretical pricing model, he can generate accurate theoretical values because\\n he has the right probabilities. Like the casino, he may lose in the short run because of bad luck, but in the long run, with the probabilities in his favor, the\\n trader can be reasonably certain of making a profit.\\n Clearly, no one knows what the future holds. However, if a trader intends to\\n use a theoretical pricing model, he must try to make an estimate of future realized volatility. In option evaluation, as in other disciplines, a good starting point\\n is historical data. What typically has been the historical realized volatility of a\\n contract? If, over the past 10 years, the volatility of a contract has never been less\\n than 10 percent nor more than 30 percent, a guess for the future volatility of either 5 or 40 percent hardly makes sense. This does not mean that either of these\\n extremes is impossible. But based on past performance, and in the absence of\\n any extraordinary circumstances, a guess within the historical limits of 10 and\\n 30 percent is probably more realistic than a guess outside these limits. Of course,\\n In order to turn price changes into continuously compounded returns, volatility is most often calculated using\\n logarithmic price changes—the natural logarithm of the current price divided by the previous price. In most cases,\\n there is little practical difference between the percent price changes and logarithmic price changes.\\n 9\\n For exchange-traded contracts, volatility calculations using daily intervals typically include only business days because these are the only days on which prices can actually change. If there are five trading days per week, a 50-day\\n volatility covers a period of approximately 10 weeks.\\n 8\\n \\n 86\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 86\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0c10 to 30 percent is still a very wide range. But at least the historical data offers a\\n starting point. Additional information may help to further narrow the estimate.\\n As option traders have come to appreciate the importance of volatility as\\n an input into a pricing model, volatility forecasting models have been developed in an attempt to more accurately predict future realized volatility. If a\\n trader has access to a volatility forecast that he believes is reliable, he will want\\n to use this forecast to make a better decision as to the future realized volatility.\\n We will put off a discussion of possible forecasting methods until later chapters.\\n When we calculate volatility over a given period of time, we still have a\\n choice of the time intervals over which to measure the price changes in the\\n underlying contract. A trader might consider whether the choice of intervals,\\n even if the intervals cover the same time period, might affect the results. For\\n example, we might look at the 250-day volatility, the 52-week volatility, and the\\n 12-month volatility of a contract. All volatilities cover approximately one year,\\n but one is calculated from daily price changes, one from weekly price changes,\\n and one from monthly price changes.\\n For most underlying contracts, the interval that is chosen does not seem to\\n greatly affect the result. It is possible that a contract will make large daily moves\\n yet finish the week unchanged. However, this is by far the exception. A contract\\n that is volatile from day to day is likely to be equally volatile from week to week\\n or month to month. Figure 6-8 shows the 250-day realized volatility of the S&P\\n 500 Index from 2003 through 2012, with the volatility calculated from price\\n changes at three different intervals: daily, weekly, and every four weeks. The\\n graphs are not identical, but they do seem to have similar characteristics. There\\n is no clear evidence that using one interval rather than another results in consistently higher or lower volatility.\\n Figure 6-8 S&P 500 Index 250-day historical volatility.\\n 50%\\n 45%\\n \\n Annualized volatility\\n \\n 40%\\n \\n Calculated from price changes…\\n Every day\\n Every week\\n Every 4 weeks\\n \\n 35%\\n 30%\\n 25%\\n 20%\\n 15%\\n 10%\\n 5%\\n Dec-02 Dec-03 Dec-04 Dec-05 Dec-06 Dec-07 Dec-08 Dec-09 Dec-10 Dec-11 Dec-12\\n \\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 87\\n \\n 87\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cImplied Volatility\\n Unlike realized volatility, which is calculated from price changes in the underlying contract, implied volatility is derived from the price of an option in the\\n marketplace. In a sense, the implied volatility represents the marketplace’s consensus of what the future realized volatility of the underlying contract will be\\n over the life of the option.\\n Consider a three-month 105 call on a stock that pays no dividend. If we\\n are interested in purchasing this call, we might use a pricing model to determine the option’s theoretical value. For simplicity, let’s assume that the option\\n is European (no early exercise) and that we will use the Black-Scholes model.\\n In addition to the exercise price, time to expiration, and type, we also need the\\n price of the stock, an interest rate, and a volatility. Suppose that the current\\n stock price is 98.50, the three-month interest rate is 6.00 percent, and our best\\n estimate of volatility over the next three months is 25 percent. When we feed\\n this data into our model, we find that the option has a theoretical value of 2.94.\\n However, when we check the price of the option in the marketplace, we find\\n that the 105 call is trading very actively at a price of 3.60. How can we account\\n for the fact that we think the option is worth 2.94, but the rest of the world\\n seems to think that it’s worth 3.60?\\n This is not an easy question to answer because there are many forces at\\n work in the marketplace that cannot be easily identified or quantified. But one\\n way we might try to answer the question is by making the assumption that\\n everyone trading the option is using the same theoretical pricing model. If we\\n make this assumption, the cause of the discrepancy must be a difference of\\n opinion about one or more of the inputs into the model. Which inputs are the\\n most likely cause?\\n It’s unlikely to be either the time to expiration or the exercise price because\\n these inputs are fixed in the option contract. What about the underlying price\\n of 98.50? Perhaps we incorrectly estimated the stock price due to the width of\\n the bid-ask spread. However, for most actively traded underlying contracts, it\\n is unlikely that the spread will be wide enough to cause a discrepancy of 0.66\\n in the value of the option. In order to yield a value of 3.60 for the 105 call, we\\n would actually have to raise the stock price to 100.16, and this is almost certainly well outside the bid-ask spread for the stock.\\n Perhaps our problem is the interest rate of 6.00 percent. But interest rates\\n are usually the least important of the inputs into a theoretical pricing model. In\\n fact, we would have to make a huge change in the interest-rate input, from 6.00\\n to 13.30 percent, to yield a theoretical value of 3.60.\\n This leaves us with one likely cause for the discrepancy—the volatility.\\n In a sense, the marketplace seems be using a volatility that is different from\\n 25 percent. To determine what volatility the marketplace is using, we can ask\\n the following question: if we hold all other inputs constant (i.e., time to expiration, exercise price, underlying price, and interest rates), what volatility must\\n we feed into our model to yield a theoretical value equal to the price of the\\n option in the marketplace? In our example, we want to know what volatility\\n will yield a value of 3.60 for the 105 call. Clearly, the volatility has to be higher\\n than 25 percent, so we might begin to raise the volatility input into our model.\\n 88\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 88\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 6-9\\n \\n Exercise price\\n (105)\\n \\n Solving for the theoretical value:\\n \\n Stock price\\n (98.50)\\n Interest rate\\n (6.00%)\\n \\n Pricing\\n model\\n \\n Time to expiration\\n (3 months)\\n \\n Theoretical\\n value\\n (2.94)\\n \\n Volatility\\n (25%)\\n \\n Exercise price\\n (105)\\n \\n Solving for the implied volatility:\\n \\n Stock price\\n (98.50)\\n Interest rate\\n (6.00%)\\n \\n Pricing\\n model\\n \\n Implied\\n volatility\\n (28.50%)\\n \\n Time to expiration\\n (3 months)\\n Option price\\n (3.60)\\n \\n If we do, we find that at a volatility of 28.50 percent, the 105 call has a theoretical value of 3.60. The implied volatility of the 105 call—the volatility being implied to the underlying contract through the pricing of the option in the\\n marketplace—is 28.50 percent.\\n When we solve for the implied volatility of an option, we are assuming that\\n the theoretical value (the option’s price), as well as all other inputs except volatility, are known. In effect, we are running the theoretical pricing model backwards to solve for the unknown volatility. In practice, this is easier said than\\n done because most theoretical pricing models do not work in reverse. However,\\n there are a number of relatively simple algorithms that can quickly solve for the\\n implied volatility when all other inputs are known.\\n Implied volatility depends not only on the inputs into the theoretical pricing model but also on the theoretical pricing model being used. For some options, different models can yield significantly different implied volatilities.\\n Problems can also arise when the inputs are not contemporaneous. If an option has not traded for some time and market conditions have changed, using\\n an outdated option price will result in a misleading or inaccurate implied volatility. Suppose in our example that the price of 3.60 for the 105 call reflected\\n the last trade, but that trade took place two hours ago when the underlying\\n stock price was actually 99.25. At a stock price of 99.25, the implied volatility of the option, at a price of 3.60, is actually 26.95 percent. This underscores\\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 89\\n \\n 89\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cthe importance of accurate and contemporaneous inputs when calculating\\n implied volatilities.\\n Brokerage firms and data vendors who provide option analysis for their clients will typically include implied volatility data. The data may incorporate implied volatilities for every option on an underlying contract, or the data may be\\n in the form of one implied volatility that is representative of options on a particular underlying market. In the latter case, the single implied volatility is usually the result of weighting the individual implied volatilities by some criteria,\\n such as volume of options traded or open interest, or, as is most common, by\\n assigning the greatest weight to the at-the-money options.\\n Implied volatility in the marketplace is constantly changing because\\n option prices, as well as other market conditions, are constantly changing. It is\\n as if the marketplace were continuously polling all the participants to come up\\n with a consensus volatility for the underlying contract for each expiration. This\\n is not a poll in the true sense because the traders do not confer with each other\\n and then vote on the correct volatility. However, as bids and offers are made,\\n the price at which an option is trading will represent an equilibrium between\\n supply and demand. This equilibrium can be expressed as an implied volatility.\\n While the term premium really refers to an option’s price, because the\\n implied volatility is derived from an option’s price, traders sometimes use premium and implied volatility interchangeably. If the current implied volatility is\\n high by historical standards or high relative to the recent historical volatility of\\n the underlying contract, a trader might say that premium levels are high; if implied volatility is unusually low, he might say that premium levels are low.\\n New option traders are taught, quite sensibly, to sell overpriced options\\n and buy underpriced options. By selling options at prices higher than theoretical value or buying options at prices lower than theoretical value, a trader\\n creates a positive theoretical edge. But how should a trader determine the degree to which an option is overpriced or underpriced? This sounds like an easy\\n question to answer. Isn’t the amount of the mispricing equal to the difference\\n between the option’s price and its value? The question arises because there is\\n more than one way to measure this difference. Returning to our example of the\\n 105 call, we might say that with a theoretical value of 2.94 and a price of 3.60,\\n the 105 call is 0.66 overpriced. But in volatility terms the option is 3.50 volatility points overpriced because its theoretical value is based on a volatility of\\n 25 percent (our volatility estimate), while its price is based on a volatility of\\n 28.50 percent (the implied volatility). Given the unusual characteristics of\\n options, it is often more useful for a trader to consider an option’s price in terms\\n of implied volatility rather than total points.\\n Implied volatility is often used by traders to compare the relative pricing\\n of options. In our example, the 105 call is trading at 3.60 with an implied volatility of 28.50 percent. Suppose that a 100 call under the same conditions is\\n trading at 5.40. In total points, the 100 call is clearly more expensive than the\\n 105 call (5.40 versus 3.60). But if, at a price of 5.40, the 100 call has an implied\\n volatility of 27.51 percent, most traders will conclude that in theoretical terms\\n the 100 call is almost a full percentage point less expensive (27.51 percent versus 28.50 percent) than the 105 call. Traders, in fact, talk about implied volatility as if it were the price of an option. A trader who buys the 100 call at a price\\n 90\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 90\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cof 5.40 might say that she bought the call at 27.51 percent. A trader who sells\\n the 105 call at a price of 3.60 might say that he sold the call at 28.50 percent.\\n Of course, options are really bought and sold in the appropriate currency. But\\n from an option trader’s point of view the implied volatility is often a more useful expression of an option’s price than its actual price in currency units.\\n Even if the implied volatility of the100 call is 27.51 percent and the\\n implied volatility of the 105 call is 28.50 percent, this does not necessarily mean\\n that a trader ought to buy the 100 call and sell the 105 call. A trader also will\\n need to consider what will happen if his estimate of volatility turns out to be\\n incorrect. If the future realized volatility over the life of the options turns out\\n to be 25 percent, both the 100 call and the 105 call are overpriced, and the sale\\n of either option should, in theory, result in a profit. But what will happen if the\\n trader’s volatility estimate is wrong, and the future realized volatility turns out\\n to be 32 percent? Now the sale of either option will result in a loss. The consequences of being wrong about volatility are an important consideration, and\\n this is something we will look at more closely in subsequent chapters. However,\\n in the absence of other considerations, the lower implied volatility of the 100\\n call suggests that it is likely to be the better value.\\n Although option traders may at times refer to any of the various interpretations of volatility, two of these stand out in importance—the future realized volatility and the implied volatility. The future realized volatility of an underlying\\n contract determines the value of options on that contract. The implied volatility\\n is a reflection of an option’s price. These two numbers, value and price, are what\\n all traders, not just option traders, are concerned with. If a contract has a high\\n value and a low price, a trader will want to be a buyer. If a contract has a low\\n value and a high price, a trader will want to be a seller. For an option trader, this\\n usually means comparing the expected future realized volatility with the implied\\n volatility. If implied volatility is low with respect to the expected future volatility,\\n a trader will prefer to buy options; if implied volatility is high, a trader will prefer to sell options. Of course, future volatility is an unknown, so a trader will look\\n at historical and, if available, forecast volatility to help in making an intelligent\\n guess about the future. In the final analysis, though, it is the future realized volatility that determines an option’s value.\\n A commonly used analogy to help new traders better understand the\\n role of volatility is to think of volatility as being similar to the weather. Suppose that a trader living in Chicago gets up on a July morning and must\\n decide what clothes to wear that day. Will he consider putting on a heavy\\n winter coat? This is probably not a logical choice because he knows that\\n historically it is not sufficiently cold in Chicago in July to warrant wearing a\\n winter coat. Next, he might turn on the radio or television to listen to the\\n weather forecast. The forecaster is predicting clear skies with very warm temperatures close to 90°F (32°C). Based on this information, the trader has decided that he will wear a short-sleeve shirt and does not need a sweater or\\n jacket. And he certainly won’t need an umbrella. However, just to be sure,\\n he decides to look out the window to see what the people passing in the\\n street are wearing. To his surprise, everyone is wearing a coat and carrying\\n an umbrella. Through their choice of clothing, the people outside are implying different weather than the forecast. Given the conflicting information,\\n V olatility\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 91\\n \\n 91\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cwhat clothes should the trader wear? He must make some decision, but\\n whom should he believe, the weather forecaster or the people in the street?\\n There can be no certain answer because the trader will not know the\\n future weather until the end of the day. Much will depend on the trader’s knowledge of local conditions. Perhaps the trader lives in an area far removed from\\n where the weather forecaster is located. Then he must give added weight to\\n local conditions.\\n The decision on what clothes to wear, like every trading decision, depends\\n on a great many factors. Not only must the decision be made on the basis of\\n the best available information, but the decision must also be made with consideration for the possibility of error. What are the benefits of being right? What\\n are the consequences of being wrong? If a trader fails to take an umbrella and\\n it rains, this may be of little consequence if the bus picks him up right outside\\n his residence and drops him off right outside his place of work. On the other\\n hand, if he must walk several blocks in the rain, he might become sick and have\\n to miss several days of work. The choices are never easy, and one can only hope\\n to make the decision that will turn out best in the long run.\\n Changing our assumptions about volatility can often have a dramatic effect\\n on the value of an option. Figure 6-10 shows the prices, theoretical values, and\\n implied volatilities for several gold options on July 31, 2012. Figure 6-11 focuses\\n specifically on how these values change as we increase volatility from 14 to\\n 18 percent. Looking for the moment at call values, although all the options increase in value, the 1600 call, the at-the-money option, increases the most, rising from 41.65 to 51.60, a total of 9.95. At the same time, the 1800 call shows\\n the greatest increase in percent terms. Its value more than triples from 0.78 to\\n 3.05, a total increase of 291 percent. These are important principles to which\\n we will return later but that are worth stating now:\\n 1. In total points, a change in volatility will have a greater effect on an\\n at-the-money option than on an equivalent in-the-money or out-ofthe-money option.\\n 2. In percent terms, a change in volatility will have a greater effect on\\n an out-of-the-money option than on an equivalent in-the-money or\\n at-the-money option.\\n These same principles apply to puts as well as calls. The 1600 put\\n increases the most in total points, rising from 29.26 to 39.21, a total of 9.95.\\n The 1400 put increases the most in percent terms, from 0.13 to 0.89, or\\n 585 percent.\\n No matter how one measures change, in-the-money options tend to be\\n the least sensitive to changes in volatility. As an option moves deeply into the\\n money, it becomes more sensitive to changes in the underlying price and less\\n sensitive to changes in volatility. Because it is often volatility characteristics that\\n investors and traders are looking for when they go into an options market, it\\n should not come as a surprise that most of the trading volume in option markets is concentrated in at-the-money and out-of-the-money options, the options\\n that are most sensitive to changes in volatility.\\n 92\\n \\n O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G\\n \\n 06-Natenberg_ch06.indd 92\\n \\n 10/10/14 2:29 PM\\n \\n \\x0cFigure 6-10 Gold eight-week (40 trading days) historical volatility.\\n July 31, 2012\\n October gold futures = 1612.4\\n Time to October expiration = 8 weeks (56 days)\\n Interest rate = 0.50%*\\n Theoretical Value If Volatility Is …\\n Exercise\\n Price\\n \\n Settlement\\n Price\\n \\n Implied\\n Volatility\\n \\n 1400\\n \\n 215.2\\n \\n 22.36%\\n \\n 212.37\\n \\n 213.13\\n \\n 214.98\\n \\n 1500\\n \\n 122.5\\n \\n 19.01%\\n \\n 116.05\\n \\n 121.01\\n \\n 127.34\\n \\n 1600\\n \\n 50.8\\n \\n 17.68%\\n \\n 41.65\\n \\n 51.6\\n \\n 61.57\\n \\n 1700\\n \\n 16.1\\n \\n 18.42%\\n \\n 8.08\\n \\n 15.28\\n \\n 23.49\\n \\n 1800\\n \\n 5.3\\n \\n 20.46%\\n \\n 0.78\\n \\n 3.05\\n \\n 7\\n \\n 1400\\n \\n 2.9\\n \\n 22.26%\\n \\n 0.13\\n \\n 0.89\\n \\n 2.74\\n \\n 1500\\n \\n 10.2\\n \\n 19.02%\\n \\n 3.74\\n \\n 8.7\\n \\n 15.02\\n \\n 1600\\n \\n 38.4\\n \\n 17.68%\\n \\n 29.26\\n \\n 39.21\\n \\n 49.18\\n \\n 1700\\n \\n 103.7\\n \\n 18.45%\\n \\n 95.61\\n \\n 102.82\\n \\n 111.03\\n \\n 1800\\n \\n 192.8\\n \\n 20.50%\\n \\n 188.23\\n \\n 190.51\\n \\n 194.46\\n \\n Volatility = 14%\\n \\n Volatility = 18%\\n \\n Volatility = 22%\\n \\n October\\n calls\\n \\n October\\n puts\\n \\n *The prices in Figures 6-10 and 6-12 occurred during a period of unusually low interest rates.\\n \\n In Figures 6-12 and 6-13, we can see that the same principles apply to\\n longer-term options. The at-the-money options (the December 1600 call and\\n put) change most in total points, whereas the out-of-the-money options (the\\n December 1800 call and 1400 put) change most in percent terms. As we would\\n expect, the December option values are greater than the October option values with the same exercise price. But look at the magnitude of the changes as\\n we change volatility. For the same exercise price, in total points, the December\\n (long-term) options always change more than the October (short-term) options.\\n This leads to a third principle of option evaluation:\\n 3. A change in volatility will have a greater effect on a long-term option\\n than an equivalent short-term option.\\n The reader may have noticed several interesting points in the foregoing\\n figures.

Is a 4 percentage point change a real possibility? In fact,\\n from Figure 6-14, the eight-week historical volatility for the 3½ years leading\\n up to July 2012, we can see that such changes are not at all uncommon.\\n Given its importance, it is not surprising that serious option traders\\n spend a considerable amount of time thinking about volatility. From the historical, forecast, and implied volatility, a trader must try to make an intelligent decision about future volatility. From this, he will try to choose option\\n strategies that will be profitable when he is right but that will not result in a\\n serious loss when he is wrong. Because of the difficulty in predicting volatility, a trader must always look for strategies that will leave the greatest margin\\n for error.

       "'1 Financial Contracts My friend Jerry lives in a small town, the same town in which he was born and raised. Because Jerry’s parents are no longer alive and many of his friends have left, he is seriously thinking of packing up and moving to a larger city. However, Jerry recently heard that there is a plan to build a major highway that will pass very close to his hometown. Because the highway is likely to bring new life to the town, Jerry is reconsidering his decision to move away. It has also occurred to Jerry that the highway may bring new business opportunities. For many years, Jerry’s family was in the restaurant business, and Jerry is thinking of building a restaurant at the main intersection leading from the highway into town. If Jerry does decide to build the restaurant, he will need to acquire land along the highway. Fortunately, Jerry has located a plot of land, currently owned by Farmer Smith, that is ideally suited for the restaurant. Because the land does not seem to be in use, Jerry is hoping that Farmer Smith might be willing to sell it. If Farmer Smith is indeed willing to sell, how can Jerry acquire the land on which to build his restaurant? First, Jerry must find out how much Farmer Smith wants for the land. Let’s say $100,000. If Jerry thinks that the price is reasonable, he can agree to pay this amount and, in return, take ownership of the land. In this case, Jerry and Farmer Smith will have entered into a spot or cash transaction. In a cash transaction, both parties agree on terms, followed immediately by an exchange of money for goods. The trading of stock on an exchange is usually considered to be a cash transaction: the buyer and seller agree on the price, the buyer pays the seller, and the seller delivers the stock. The actions essentially take place simultaneously. (Admittedly, on most stock exchanges, there is a settlement period between the time the price is agreed on and the time the stock is actually delivered and payment is made. However, the settlement period is relatively short, so for practical purposes most traders consider this a cash transaction.) However, it has also occurred to Jerry that it will probably take several years to build the highway. Because Jerry wants the opening of his restaurant  to coincide with the opening of the highway, he doesn’t need to begin construction on the restaurant for at least another year. There is no point in taking possession of the land right now—it will just sit unused for a year. Given his construction schedule, Jerry has decided to approach Farmer Smith with a slightly different proposition. Jerry will agree to Farmer Smith’s price of $100,000, but he will propose to Farmer Smith that they complete the transaction in one year, at which time Farmer Smith will receive payment, and Jerry will take possession of the land. If both parties agree to this, Jerry and Farmer Smith will have entered into a forward contract. In a forward contract, the parties agree on the terms now, but the actual exchange of money for goods does not take place until some later date, the maturity or expiration date. If Jerry and Farmer Smith enter into a forward contract, it’s unlikely that the price Farmer Smith will want for his land in one year will be the same price that he is asking today. Because both the payment and the transfer of goods are deferred, there may be advantages or disadvantages to one party or the other. Farmer Smith may point out that if he receives full payment of $100,000 right now, he can deposit the money in his bank and begin to earn interest. In a forward contract, however, he will have to forego any interest earnings. As a result, Farmer Smith may insist that he and Jerry negotiate a one-year forward price that takes into consideration this loss of interest. Forward contracts are common when a potential buyer requires goods in the future or when a potential seller knows that a supply of goods will be ready for sale in the future. A bakery may need a periodic supply of grain to support operations. Some grain may be required now, but the bakery also knows that additional grain will be required at regular intervals in the future. In order to eliminate the risk of rising grain prices, the bakery can buy grain in the forward market—agreeing on a price now but not taking delivery or making payment until some later date. In the same way, a farmer who knows that he will have grain ready for harvest at a later date can sell his crop in the forward market to insure against falling prices. When a forward contract is traded on an organized exchange, it is usually referred to as a futures contract. On a futures exchange, the contract specifications for a forward contract are standardized to more easily facilitate trading. The exchange specifies the quantity and quality of goods to be delivered, the date and place of delivery, and the method of payment. Additionally, the exchange guarantees the integrity of the contract. Should either the buyer or the seller default, the exchange assumes the responsibility of fulfilling the terms of the forward contract. The earliest futures exchanges enabled producers and users of physical commodities—grains, precious metals, and energy products—to protect themselves against price fluctuations. More recently, many exchanges have introduced futures contracts on financial instruments—stocks and stock indexes, interest-rate contracts, and foreign currencies. Although there is still significant trading in physical commodities, the total value of exchange-traded financial instruments now greatly exceeds the value of physical commodities. Returning to Jerry, he finds that he has a new problem. The government has indicated its desire to build the highway, but the necessary funds have not 2  yet been authorized. With many other public works projects competing for a limited amount of money, it’s possible that the entire highway project could be canceled. If this happens, Jerry intends to return to his original plan and move away. In order to make an informed decision, Jerry needs time to see what the government will do. If the highway is actually built, Jerry wants to purchase Farmer Smith’s land. If the highway isn’t built, Jerry wants to be able to walk away without any obligation. Jerry believes that he will know for certain within a year whether the highway project will be approved. As a result, Jerry approaches Farmer Smith with a new proposition. Jerry and Farmer Smith will negotiate a one-year forward price for the land, but Jerry will have one year to decide whether to go ahead with the purchase. One year from now, Jerry can either buy the land at the agreed-on forward price, or he can walk away with no obligation or penalty. There is much that can happen over one year, and without some inducement Farmer Smith is unlikely to agree to this proposal. Someone may make a better offer for the land, but Farmer Smith will be unable to accept the offer because he must hold the land in the event that Jerry decides to buy. For the next year, Farmer Smith will be a hostage to Jerry’s final decision. Jerry understands Farmer Smith’s dilemma, so he offers to negotiate a separate payment to compensate Farmer Smith for this uncertainty. In effect, Jerry is offering to buy the right to decide at a later date whether to purchase the land. Regardless of Jerry’s final decision, Farmer Smith will get to keep this separate payment. If Jerry and Farmer Smith can agree on this separate payment, as well as the forward price, they will enter into an option contract. An option contract gives one party the right to make a decision at a later date. In this example, Jerry is the buyer of a call option, giving him the right to decide at a later date whether to buy. Farmer Smith is the seller of the call option. Deciding whether to buy the land for his restaurant is not Jerry’s only problem. He owns a house that he inherited from his parents and that he was planning to sell prior to moving away. Before hearing about the highway project, Jerry had put up a “For Sale” sign in front of the house, and a young couple, seeing the sign, showed enough interest in the house to make an offer. Jerry was seriously considering accepting the offer, but then the highway project came up. Now Jerry doesn’t know what to do. If the government goes ahead with the highway and Jerry goes ahead with his restaurant, he wants to keep his house. If not, he wants to sell the house. Given the situation, Jerry might make a proposal to the couple similar to that which he made to Farmer Smith. Jerry and the couple will agree on a price for the house, but Jerry will have one year in which to decide whether to actually sell the house. Like Farmer Smith, the couple’s initial reaction is likely to be negative. If they agree to Jerry’s proposal, they will have to make temporary housing arrangements for the next year. If they find another house they like better, they won’t be able to buy it because they might eventually be required to purchase Jerry’s house. They will spend the next year in housing limbo, a hostage to Jerry’s final decision. As with Farmer Smith, Jerry understands the couple’s dilemma and offers to compensate them for their inconvenience by paying an agreed-on amount. 10/10/14 2:19 PM  \\x0cRegardless of Jerry’s final decision, the couple will get to keep this amount. If Jerry and the couple can agree on terms, Jerry will have purchased a put option from the couple. A put option gives one party the right to decide whether to sell at a later date. Perhaps the most familiar type of option contract is insurance. In many ways an insurance contract is analogous to a put option. A homeowner who purchases insurance has the right to sell all or part of the home back to the insurance company at a later date. If the home should burn to the ground, the homeowner will inform the insurance company that he now wishes to sell the home back to the insurance company for the insured amount. Even though the home no longer exists, the insurance company is paying the homeowner as if it were actually purchasing the home. Of course, if the house does not burn down, perhaps even appreciating in value, the homeowner is under no obligation to sell the property to the insurance company. As with an insurance contract, the purchase of an option involves the payment of a premium. This amount is negotiated between the buyer and the seller, and the seller keeps the premium regardless of any subsequent decision on the part of the buyer. Many terms of an insurance contract are similar to the terms of an option contract. An option, like an insurance contract, has an expiration date. Does a homeowner want a six-month insurance policy? A one-year policy? The insurance contract may also specify an exercise price, how much the holder will receive if certain events occur. This exercise price, which may also include a deductible amount, is analogous to an agreed-on forward price. The logic used to price option contracts is also similar to the logic used to price insurance contracts. What is the probability that a house will burn down? What is the probability that someone will have an automobile accident? What is the probability that someone will die? By assigning probabilities to different occurrences, an insurance company will try to determine a fair value for the insurance contract. The insurance company hopes to generate a profit by selling the contract to the customer at a price greater than its fair value. In the same way, someone dealing with exchange-traded contracts may also ask, “What is the probability that this contract will go up in value? What is the probability that this contract will go down in value?” By assigning probabilities to different outcomes, it may be possible to determine the contract’s fair value. In later chapters we will take a closer look at how forwards, futures, and options are priced. For now, we can see that their values are likely to depend on or be derived from the value of some underlying asset. When my friend Jerry wanted to enter into a one-year forward contract to buy the land from Farmer Smith, the value of the forward contract derived from (among other things) the current value of the land. When Jerry was considering buying a call option from Farmer Smith, the value of that option derived from the value of the forward contract. When Jerry was considering selling his house, the value of the put option derived from the current value of the house. For this reason, forwards, futures, and options are commonly referred to as derivative contracts or, simply, derivatives. 4  There is one other common type of derivatives contract. A swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows. The most common type, a plain-vanilla interest-rate swap, is an agreement to exchange fixed interest-rate payments for floating interest-rate payments. But a swap can consist of almost any type of cash-flow agreement between two parties. Because swaps are not standardized and therefore most often traded off exchanges, in this text we will restrict our discussion to the most common derivatives—forwards, futures, and options.  Buying and Selling We usually assume that in order to sell something, we must first own it. For most transactions, the normal order is to buy first and sell later. However, in derivative markets, the order can be reversed. Instead of buying first and selling later, we can sell first and buy later. The profit that results from a purchase and sale is usually independent of the order in which the transactions occur. We will show a profit if we either buy first at a low price and sell later at a high price or sell first at a high price and buy later at a low price. Sometimes we may want to specify the order in which trades take place. The first trade to take place, either buying or selling, is an opening trade, resulting in an open position. A subsequent trade, reversing the initial trade, is a closing trade. A widely used measure of trading activity in exchange-traded derivative contracts is the amount of open interest, the number of contracts traded on an exchange that have not yet been closed out. Logically, the number of long and short contracts that have not been closed out must be equal because for every buyer there must be a seller. If a trader first buys a contract (an opening trade), he is long the contract. If the trader first sells a contract (also an opening trade), he is short the contract. Long and short tend to describe a position once it has been taken, but traders also refer to the act of making an opening trade as either going long (buying) or going short (selling). Buy first  Open long position  Opening trade  Sell first  Sell later  Closing trade  Open short position  Buy later  A long position will usually result in a debit (we must pay money when we buy), and a short position will usually result in a credit (we expect to receive money when we sell). We will see later that these terms are also used when trading multiple contracts, simultaneously buying some contracts and selling others. When the total trade results in a debit, it is a long position; when it results in a credit, it is a short position. 10/10/14 2:19 PM  \\x0cThe terms long and short may also refer to whether a trader wants the market to rise or fall. A trader who has a long stock market position wants the stock market to rise. A trader who has a short position wants the market to fall. However, when referring to derivatives, the terms can be confusing because a trader who has bought, or is long, a derivative may in fact want the underlying market to fall in price. In order to avoid confusion, we will refer to either a long or short contract position (we have either bought or sold contracts) or a long or short market position (we want the underlying market to rise or fall).  Notional Value of a Forward Contract Because a forward contract is an agreement to exchange money for goods at some later date, when a forward contract is initially traded, no money changes hands. Because no cash flow results, in a sense, there is no cash value associated with the contract. But a forward contract does have a notional value or nominal value. For physical commodities, the notional value of a forward contract is equal to the number of units to be delivered at maturity multiplied by the unit price. If a forward contract calls for the delivery of 1,000 units at a price of $75 per unit, the notional value of the contract is $75 × 1,000 = $75,000. For some forward contracts, physical delivery is not practical. For example, many exchanges trade futures contracts on stock indexes. But it would be impractical to actually deliver a stock index because it would require the delivery of all stocks in the index in exactly the right proportion, which in some cases might mean delivering fractional shares. For financial futures, where the contract is not settled through physical delivery, the notional value is equal to the cash price of the index or instrument multiplied by a point value. A stock index that is trading at 825.00 and that has a point value of $200 has a notional value of 825.00 × $200 = $165,000. The point value of a stock index or similar contract is set by the exchange so that the contract has a notional value that is deemed reasonable for trading. If the point value is set too high, trading in the contract may be too risky for most market participants. If the point value is set too low, transaction costs may be prohibitive because it may require trading a large number of contracts to achieve the desired result.  Settlement Procedures What actually happens when a contract is traded on an exchange? The settlement procedure—the manner in which the transfer of money and ownership of a contract is facilitated—depends on the rules of the exchange and the type of contract traded. Consider a trader who buys 100 shares of a $50 stock on an exchange. The total value of the stock is 100 × $50 = $5,000, and the buyer is required to pay the seller this amount. The exchange, acting as intermediary, collects $5,000 from the buyer and transfers this money to the seller. At the same time, the exchange takes 6  delivery of the shares from the seller and transfers these to the buyer. This is essentially a cash transaction with the exchange making both delivery and payment. Suppose that the stock that was originally purchased at $50 per share subsequently rises to $60. How will the buyer feel? He will certainly be happy and may mentally record a profit of $1,000 (100 shares times the $10 increase per share). But he can’t actually spend this $1,000 because the profit is unrealized —it only appears on paper (hence the term paper profit). If the buyer wants to spend the $1,000, he will have to turn it into a realized profit by going back into the marketplace and selling his 100 shares to someone else at $60 per share. This stock-type settlement requires full and immediate payment, and all profits or losses are unrealized until the position is closed. Now consider what happens when a futures contract is traded on an exchange. Because a futures contract is a forward contract, there is no immediate exchange of money for goods. The buyer pays no money, and the seller receives none. But by entering into a forward contract, both the buyer and the seller have taken on future obligations. At contract maturity, the seller is obligated to deliver, and the buyer is obligated to pay. The exchange wants to ensure that both parties live up to these obligations. To do this, the exchange collects a margin deposit from each party that it holds as security against possible default by the buyer or seller. The amount of margin is commensurate with the risk to the exchange and depends on the notional value of the contract, as well as the possibility of price fluctuations over the life of the futures contract. An exchange will try to set margin requirements high enough so that the exchange is reasonably protected against default but not so high that it inhibits trading. For example, consider the futures contract calling for delivery of 1,000 units of a commodity at a unit price of $75. The notional value of the contract is $75,000. If the exchange has set a margin requirement for the contract at $3,000, when the contract is traded, both the buyer and seller must immediately deposit $3,000 with the exchange. What happens if the price of the commodity subsequently rises to $80? Now the buyer has a profit of $5 × 1,000 = $5,000, whereas the seller has a loss of equal amount. As a result, the exchange will now transfer $5,000 from the seller’s account to the buyer’s account. This daily variation credit or debit results from fluctuations in the price of the futures contract as long as the position remains open. Futures-type settlement, where there is an initial margin deposit followed by daily cash transfers, is also known as margin and variation settlement. A futures trader can close out a position in one of two ways. Prior to maturity of the futures contract, he can make an offsetting trade, selling out the futures contract he initially bought or buying back the futures contract he initially sold. If the position is closed through an offsetting purchase or sale, a final variation payment is made, and the margin deposit is returned to the trader. Alternatively, a trader may choose to carry the position to maturity, at which time physical settlement will take place. The seller must make delivery, and the buyer must pay an amount equal to the current value of the commodity. After delivery and payment have been made, the margin deposits will be returned to the respective parties. In our example, the original trade price was $75. If the price of the commodity at maturity is $90, the buyer must pay $90 × 1,000 = $90,000. 10/10/14 2:19 PM  \\x0cIt may seem that the buyer has paid $15 more per unit than the original trade price of $75. But recall that as the futures contract rose in price from $75 to $90, the buyer was credited with $15 in the form of variation. The total price paid, the $90 final price less the $15 variation, was indeed equal to the agreedon price of $75 per unit. Futures contracts such as stock indexes, which are not settled through physical delivery, can also be carried to maturity. In this case, there is one final variation payment based on the underlying index price at maturity. At that time, the margin deposits are also returned to the parties. These types of futures, where no physical delivery takes place at maturity, are said to be cash-settled. A futures trader must always have sufficient funds to cover the margin requirements for any trade he intends to make. But he should also have sufficient funds to cover any variation requirements. If the position moves against him and he does not have sufficient funds, he may be forced to close the position earlier than intended. There is an important distinction between margin and variation. Margin1 is money collected by the exchange to ensure that a trader can fulfill future financial obligations should the market move against him. Even though deposited with the exchange, margin deposits still belong to the trader and can therefore earn interest for the trader. Variation is a credit or debit that results from fluctuations in the price of a futures contract. A variation payment can either earn interest, if the variation results in a credit, or lose interest, if the variation results in a debit. Examples of the cash flows and profit or loss for a series of stock and futures trades are shown in Figures 1-1 and 1-2, respectively. In each example, we assume that the opening trade was made at the first day’s settlement price so that there is no profit and loss (i.e., a P&L of zero) at the end of day 1. For simplicity, we have also ignored any interest earned on credits or interest paid on debits. We make this very important distinction between stock-type settlement and futures-type settlement because some contracts are settled like stock and some contracts are settled like futures. It should come as no surprise that stock Figure 1-1\\u2002Stock-type settlement.

But what about options? Currently, all exchange-traded options in North America, whether options on stock, stock indexes, futures, or foreign currencies, are settled like stock. Options must be paid for immediately and in full, and all profits or losses are unrealized until the position is liquidated. In stock option markets, this is both logical and consistent because both the underlying contract and options on that contract are settled using identical procedures. However, on U.S. futures options markets, the underlying contract is settled one way (futurestype settlement), while the options are settled in a different way (stock-type settlement). This can sometimes cause problems when a trader has bought or sold an option to hedge a futures position. Even if the profits from the option position exactly offset the losses from the futures position, the profits from the option position, because the options are settled like stock, are unrealized. But the losses from the futures position will require an immediate cash outlay to cover variation requirements. If a trader is unaware of the different settlement procedures, he can occasionally find himself with unexpected cash-flow problems. The settlement situation on most exchanges outside North America has been simplified by making option and underlying settlement procedures identical. If the underlying is subject to stock-type settlement, then the options on the underlying are subject to stock-type settlement. If the underlying is subject to futures-type settlement, then the options are subject to futures-type settlement. Under this method, a trader is unlikely to have a surprise variation requirement on a position that he thinks is well hedged. In this text, when presenting option examples, we will generally assume the settlement convention used in North America, where all options are subject to stock-type settlement. 10/10/14 2:19 PM  \\x0cMarket Integrity Anyone who enters into a contract to buy or sell wants to be confident that the counterparty will fulfill his responsibilities under the terms of the contract. A buyer wants to be sure that the seller will deliver; a seller wants to be sure that the buyer will pay. No one will want to trade in a marketplace if there is a real possibility that the counterparty might default on a contract. To guarantee the integrity of an exchange-traded contract, exchanges assume the responsibility for both delivery and payment. When a trade is made on an exchange, the link between buyer and seller is immediately broken and replaced with two new links. The exchange becomes the buyer from each seller. If the buyer defaults, the exchange will guarantee payment. The exchange also becomes the seller to each buyer. If the seller defaults, the exchange will guarantee delivery. To protect itself against possible default, an exchange will establish a clearinghouse. The clearinghouse may be a division of the exchange or a completely independent entity and is responsible for processing and guaranteeing all trades made on the exchange.2 The clearinghouse assumes the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the integrity of all exchange-traded contracts.3 Figure 1-3 The clearing process. 1. The buyer and seller agree on a contract, quantity, and price 2a. The buyer reports the trade to his clearing firm  Exchange floor or electronic network  Buyer’s clearing firm  2b. The seller reports the trade to his clearing firm  Seller’s clearing firm  4. If the reports from both clearing firms match, the trade becomes official 3a. The buyer’s clearing firm reports the trade to the clearinghouse  Clearinghouse 5. If the reports do not match, each clearing firm is informed. The clearing firms then return the trade to the buyer and seller for resolution  3b. The seller’s clearing firm reports the trade to the clearinghouse  In the United States, the two largest derivatives clearinghouses are the Options Clearing Corporation, responsible for processing all equity option trades, and the CME Clearing House, responsible for processing all trades made on exchanges falling within the CME Group. For instruments other than derivatives, such as stock and bonds, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation provides clearing services for many U.S. exchanges. 3 Although the exchange and clearinghouse may be separate entities, for simplicity, we will occasionally use the terms interchangeably. 2  10  The clearinghouse is made up of member clearing firms. A clearing firm processes trades made by individual traders and agrees to fulfill any financial obligation arising from those trades. Should an individual trader default, the clearing firm guarantees fulfillment of that trader’s responsibilities. No individual may trade on an exchange without first becoming associated with a clearing firm. As part of its responsibilities, a clearing firm will collect the required margin from individual traders and deposit these funds with the clearinghouse.4 In some cases, the clearinghouse may permit a clearing firm to aggregate the positions of all traders at the firm. Because some traders will have long positions while other traders will have short positions in the same contract, the clearinghouse may reduce the margin deposits required from the clearing firm. At its discretion, and depending on market conditions, a clearing firm may require an individual trader to deposit more money with the clearing firm than is required by the clearinghouse. The current system of guarantees—individual trader, clearing firm, and clearinghouse—has proven effective in ensuring the integrity of exchangetraded contracts. Although individual traders and clearing firms occasionally fail, a clearinghouse has never failed in the United States.  We noted earlier that, in theory, there is no loss of interest associated with a margin deposit. In practice, the amount of interest paid on margin deposits will vary by clearing firm and is typically negotiated between the clearing firm and the individual customer. 4  10/10/14 2:19 PM  \\x0c2 Forward Pricing What should be the fair price for a forward contract? We can answer this question by considering the costs and benefits of buying now compared with buying on some future date. In a forward contract, the costs and benefits are not eliminated; they are simply deferred. They should therefore be reflected in the forward price. forward price = current cash price + costs of buying now – benefits of buying now Let’s return to our example from Chapter 1 where my friend Jerry wanted to acquire land on which to build a restaurant. He was considering both a cash purchase and a one-year forward contract. If he enters into a forward contract, what should be a fair one-year forward price for the land? If Jerry wants to buy the land right now, he will have to pay Farmer Smith’s asking price of $100,000. However, in researching the feasibility of a one-year forward contract, Jerry has learned the following: 1. The cost of money, whether borrowing or lending,1 is currently 8.00 percent annually. 2. The owner of the land must pay $2,000 in real estate taxes; the taxes are due in nine months. 3. There is a small oil well on the land that pumps oil at the rate of $500 per month; the oil revenue is receivable at the end of each month. If Jerry decides to buy the land now, what are the costs compared with buying the land one year from now? First, Jerry will have to borrow $100,000 from the local bank. At a rate of 8 percent, the one-year interest costs will be 8% × $100,000 = $8,000 At this point, we will assume that the same interest rate applies to all transactions, whether borrowing or lending. Admittedly, for a trader, the interest cost of borrowing will almost always be higher than the interest earned when lending. 1  If Jerry buys the land now, he will also be liable for the $2,000 in property taxes due in nine months. In order to pay the taxes, he will need to borrow an additional $2,000 from the bank for the remaining three months of the forward contract $2,000 + ($2,000 × 8% × 3/12) = $2,000 + $40 = $2,040 The total costs of buying now are the interest on the cash price, the real estate taxes, and the interest on the taxes $8,000 + $2,040 = $10,040 What are the benefits of buying now? If Jerry buys the land now, at the end of each month he will receive $500 worth of oil revenue. Over the 12-month life of the forward contract, he will receive 12 × $500 = $6,000 Additionally, Jerry can earn interest on the oil revenue. At the end of the first month, he will be able to invest $500 for 11 months at 8 percent. At the end of the second month, he will be able to invest $500 for 10 months. The total interest on the oil revenue is ($500 × 8% × 11/12) + ($500 × 8% × 10/12) + … + ($500 × 8% × 1/12) = $220 The total benefits of buying now are the oil revenue plus the interest on the oil revenue $6,000 + $220 = $6,220 If there are no other considerations, a fair one-year forward price for the land ought to be The current cash price Plus the costs of buying now Less the benefits of buying now \\t\\t\\t\\t  $100,000 +$ 10,040 –$ 6,220 $103,820  Assuming that Jerry and Farmer Smith agree on all these calculations, it should make no difference to either party whether Jerry purchases the land now at a price of $100,000 or enters into a forward contract to purchase the land one year from now at a price of $103,820. The transactions are essentially the same. Traders in forward or futures contracts sometimes refer to the basis, the difference between the cash price and the forward price. In our example, the basis is $100,000 – $103,820 = –$3,820 In most cases, the basis will be a negative number—the costs of buying now will outweigh the benefits of buying now. However, in our example, the basis will turn positive if the price of oil rises enough. If one year’s worth of oil revenue, 10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0ctogether with the interest earned on the revenue, is greater than the $10,040 cost of buying now, the forward price will be less than the cash price. Consequently, the basis will be positive. How should we calculate the fair forward price for exchange-traded futures contracts? This depends on the costs and benefits associated with a position in the underlying contract. The costs and benefits for some commonly traded futures are listed in the following table: Instrument  Costs of Buying Now  Benefits of Buying Now  Physical commodity  Interest on cash price Storage costs Insurance costs  Convenience yield (to be discussed)  Stock  Interest on stock price  Dividends (if any) Interest on dividends  Bonds and notes  Interest on bond or note price  Coupon payments Interest on coupon payments  Foreign currency  Interest cost of borrowing the domestic currency  Interest earned on the foreign currency  Physical Commodities (Grains, Energy Products, Precious Metals, etc.) If we buy a physical commodity now, we will have to pay the current price together with the interest on this amount. Additionally, we will have to store the commodity until maturity of the forward contract. When we store the commodity, we would also be wise to insure it against possible loss while in storage. If C = commodity price2 t = time to maturity of the forward contract r = interest rate s = annual storage costs per commodity unit i = annual insurance costs per commodity unit3 then the forward price F can be written as F = C × (1 + r × t) + (s × t) + (i × t) Initially, it may seem that there are no benefits to buying a physical commodity, so the basis should always be negative. A normal or contango commodity market is one in which long-term futures contracts trade at a premium to short-term contracts. But sometimes the opposite occurs—a futures contract will trade at a discount to cash. If the cash price of a commodity is greater than a futures price, the market is backward or in backwardation. This seems illogical because the interest In this chapter only, we will use a capital C to represent the price of a commodity. In all other chapters, C will refer to the price of a call option. 3 For physical commodities, both storage and insurance costs usually are quoted together as one price. 2  10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cand storage costs will always be positive. However, consider a company that needs a commodity to keep its factory running. If the company cannot obtain the commodity, it may have to take the very costly step of temporarily closing the factory. The cost of such drastic action may, in the company’s view, be prohibitive. In order to avoid this, the company may be willing to pay an inflated price to obtain the commodity right now. If commodity supplies are tight, the price that the company may have to pay could result in a backward market—the cash price will be greater than the price of a futures contract. The benefit of being able to obtain a commodity right now is sometimes referred to as a convenience yield. It can be difficult to assign an exact value to the convenience yield. However, if interest costs, storage costs, and insurance costs are known, a trader can infer the convenience yield by observing the relationship between the cash price and futures prices. For example, consider a three-month forward contract on a commodity Three-month forward price F = $77.40 Interest rate r = 8 percent Annual storage costs s = $3.00 Annual insurance costs i = $0.60 What should be the cash price C? If F = C × (1 + r × t) + (s × t) + (i × t) then C=  F − (s + i ) × t 1+ r × t  =  77.40 − (3.00 + 0.60) × 3 /12 1 + 0.08 × 3 /12  =  76.50 = $75.00 1.02  If the cash price in the marketplace is actually $76.25, the convenience yield ought to be $1.25. This is the additional amount users are willing to pay for the benefit of having immediate access to the commodity.  Stock If we buy stock now, we will have to pay the current price together with the interest on this amount. In return, we will receive any dividends that the stock pays over the life of the forward contract together with the interest earned on the dividend payments. If S = stock price t = time to maturity of the forward contract r = interest rate over the life of the forward contract di = \\x07each dividend payment expected prior to maturity of the forward contract 10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cti = time remaining to maturity after each dividend payment ri = \\x07the applicable interest rate (the forward rate4) from each dividend payment to maturity of the forward contract then the forward price F can be written as F = S + (S × r × t) – [d1 × (1 + r1 × t1)] – … –[dn × (1 + rn × tn)] = [S × (1 + r × t)] – ∑[dn × (1 + rn × tn)] Example Stock price S = $67.00 Time to maturity t = 8 months Interest rate r = 6.00 percent Semiannual dividend payment d = $0.33 Time to next dividend payment = 1 month From this, we know that t1 = 8 months – 1 month = 7 months t2 = 8 months – 1 month – 6 months = 1 month If r1 = 6.20% r2 = 6.50% then a fair eight-month forward price for the stock should be F = [67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12)] – [0.33 × (1 + 0.062 × 7/12)] – [0.33 × (1 + 0.065 × 1/12)] = 69.68 – 0.3419 – 0.3318 = 69.0063 Except for long-term stock forward contracts, there will usually be a limited number of dividend payments, and the amount of interest that can be earned on each payment will be small. For simplicity, we will aggregate all the dividends D expected over the life of the forward contract and ignore any interest that can be earned on the dividends. The forward price for a stock can then be written as F = [S × (1 + r × t)] – D  The forward rate is the rate of interest that is applicable beginning on some future date for a specified period of time. Forward rates are often expressed in months 1 × 5 forward rate A four-month rate beginning in one month 3 × 9 forward rate A six-month rate beginning in three months 4 × 12 forward rate An eight-month rate beginning in four months A forward-rate agreement (FRA) is an agreement to borrow or lend money for a fixed period, beginning on some future date. A 3 × 9 FRA is an agreement to borrow money for six months, but beginning three months from now. 4  10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cAn approximate eight-month forward price should be 67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12) – (2 × 0.33) = 69.02  Bonds and Notes If we treat the coupon payments as if they were dividends, we can evaluate bond and note forward contracts in a similar manner to stock forwards. We must pay the bond price together with the interest cost on that price. In return, we will receive fixed coupon payments on which we can earn interest. If B = bond price t = time to maturity of the forward contract r = interest rate over the life of the forward contract ci = each coupon expected prior to maturity of the forward contract ti = time remaining to maturity after each coupon payment ri = \\x07applicable interest rate from each coupon payment to maturity of the forward contract then the forward price F can be written as F = B + (B × r × t) – [c1 × (1 + r1 × t1)] – … –[cn × (1 + rn × tn)] = [B × (1 + r × t)] – ∑[cn × (1 + rn × tn)] Example Bond price B = $109.76 Time to maturity t = 10 months Interest rate r = 8.00 percent Semiannual coupon payment c = 5.25 percent Time to next coupon payment = 2 months From this, we know that t1 = 10 months – 2 months = 8 months t2 = 10 months – 2 months – 6 months = 2 months If r1 = 8.20% r2 = 8.50% then a fair 10-month forward price for the bond should be F = [109.76 × (1 + 0.08 × 10/12)] – [5.25 × (1 + 0.082 × 8/12)] – [5.25 × (1 + 0.085 × 2/12)] = 117.0773 – 5.5370 – 5.3244 = 106.2159  Foreign Currencies With foreign-currency forward contracts, we must deal with two different rates—the domestic interest rate we must pay on the domestic currency to buy 10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cthe foreign currency and the foreign interest rate we earn if we hold the foreign currency. Unfortunately, if we begin with the spot exchange rate, add the domestic interest costs, and subtract the foreign-currency benefits, we get an answer that is expressed in different units. To calculate a foreign-currency forward price, we must first express the spot exchange rate S as a fraction—the cost of one foreign-currency unit in terms of domestic-currency units Cd divided by one foreign-currency unit Cf S=  Cd Cf  Suppose that we have a domestic rate rd and a foreign rate rf . What should be the forward exchange rate at the end of time t? If we invest Cf at rf and we invest Cd at rf , the exchange rate at time t ought to be F= =  C d × (1 + rd × t ) C f × (1 + r f × t ) C d 1 + rd × t × C f 1 + rf × t  =S×  1 + rd × t 1 + rf × t  For example, suppose that €1.00 = $1.50. Then S=  1.50 = 1.50 1.00  If Dollar interest rate r$ = 6.00% Euro interest rate r€ = 4.00% then the six-month forward price is F=  1.00 × (1 + 0.04 × 6 /12)  =  1.50 1 + 0.06 × 6 /12 × 1.00 1.00 × (1 + 0.04 × 6 /12)  =  1.50 × 1.30 = 1.5147 1.02  V O L A T I L I T Y AND P RICING  10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cStock and Futures Options In this text we will focus primarily on the two most common classes of exchangetraded options—stock options and futures options.5 Although there is some trading in options on physical commodities, bonds, and foreign currencies in the over-the-counter (OTC) market,6 almost all exchange-traded options on these instruments are futures options. A trader in exchange-traded options on crude oil is really trading options on crude oil futures. A trader in exchangetraded bond options is really trading options on bond futures. For both stock options and futures options, the value of the option will depend on the forward price for the underlying contract. We have already looked at the forward price for a stock. But what is the forward price for a futures contract? A futures contract is a forward contract. Therefore, the forward price for a futures contract is the futures price. If a three-month futures contract is trading at $75.00, the three-month forward price is $75.00. If a six-month futures contract is trading at $80.00, the six-month forward price is $80.00. In some ways, this makes options on futures easier to evaluate than options on stock because no additional calculation is required to determine the forward price.  Arbitrage If asked to define the term arbitrage, a trader might describe it as “a trade that results in a riskless profit.” Whether there is such a thing as a riskless profit is open for debate because there is almost always something that can go wrong. For our purposes, we will define arbitrage as the buying and selling of the same or very closely related instruments in different markets to profit from an apparent mispricing. For example, consider a commodity that is trading in London at a price of $700 per unit and trading in New York at a price of $710 per unit. Ignoring transaction costs and any currency risk, there seems to be an arbitrage opportunity by purchasing the commodity in London and simultaneously selling it in New York. Will this yield an arbitrage profit of $10? Or are there other factors that must be considered? One consideration might be transportation costs. The buyer in New York will expect delivery of the commodity. If the commodity is purchased in London, and if it costs more than $10 per unit to ship the commodity from London to New York, any arbitrage profit will be offset by the transportation costs. Even if transportation costs are less than $10, there are also insurance costs because no one will want to risk loss of the commodity in transit, either by air or by sea, from London to New York. Of course, anyone trading a commodity professionally ought to know the transportation and insurance costs. Consequently, it will be immediately obvious whether an arbitrage profit is possible. In a foreign-currency market, a trader may attempt to profit by borrowing a low-interest-rate domestic currency and using this to purchase a Later, in Chapter 22, we will also look at stock index futures and options. The OTC market, or over-the-counter market, is a term usually applied to trading that does not take place on an organized exchange. 5 6  10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0chigh-interest-rate foreign currency. The trader hopes to pay a low interest rate and simultaneously earn a high interest rate. However, this type of carry trade is not without risk. The interest rates may not be fixed, and over the life of the strategy, the interest rate that must be paid on the domestic currency may rise while the interest rate that can be earned on the foreign currency may fall. Moreover, the exchange rate is not fixed. At some point, the trader will have to repay the domestic currency that he borrowed. He expects to do this with the foreign currency that he now owns. If the value of the foreign currency has declined with respect to the domestic currency, it will cost him more to repurchase the domestic currency and repay the loan. The carry trade is sometimes referred to as arbitrage, but in fact, it entails so many risks that the term is probably misapplied. Because cash markets and futures markets are so closely related, a common type of cash-and-carry arbitrage involves buying in the cash market, selling in the futures market, and carrying the position to maturity. Returning to our previous stock example: Stock price S = $67.00 Time to maturity t = 8 months Interest rate r = 6.00 percent Expected dividends D = 0.66 Ignoring interest on the dividend, the calculated eight-month forward price is 67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 69.02 Suppose that there is a market in forward contracts on this stock and that the price of an eight-month forward contract is $69.50. What will a trader do? If the trader believes that the contract is worth only $69.02, he will sell the forward contract at $69.50 and simultaneously buy the stock for $67.00. The cash-and-carry arbitrage profit should be 69.50 – 69.02 = 0.48 To confirm this, we can list all the cash flows associated with the transaction, keeping in mind that at maturity the trader will deliver the stock and in return receive the agreed-on forward price of 69.50. Cost of borrowing $67.00 for eight months at 6 percent (67.00 × 0.06 × 8/12) –2.68 Cost of buying the stock –67.00 Dividend payment of 0.66 +0.66 Forward price received at maturity +69.50 Total of all cash flows +0.48 Fluctuations in the price of either the stock or the futures contract will not affect the results. Both the initial stock price ($67.00) and the price to be paid for the stock at maturity ($69.50) are fixed and cannot be changed. Even though fluctuations in the stock or futures price do not represent a risk, other factors may affect the outcome of the strategy. If interest rates rise, the interest costs associated with buying the stock will rise, reducing the 10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cpotential profit.7 Moreover, unless the company has actually announced the amount of the dividend, the expected dividend payment might be an estimate based on the company’s past dividend payments. If the company unexpectedly cuts the dividend, the arbitrage profit will be reduced. Given the apparent mispricing of the futures contract, a trader might question his own evaluation. Is $69.02 an accurate forward price? Perhaps the interest rate of 6 percent is too low. Perhaps the dividend of $0.66 is too high. We initially made our calculations by solving for F in terms of the spot price, time, interest rates, and dividends F = [S × (1 + r × t)] – D If we know the forward price F but are missing one of the other values, we can solve for that missing value. If we know the forward price, time to maturity, interest rate, and dividend, we can solve for S, the implied spot price of the underlying contract S=  F +D 1+ r × t  If we know everything except the interest rate r, we can solve for the implied interest rate r=  [( F + D )/S ] − 1 t  If we know everything except the dividend D, we can solve for the implied dividend D = [S × (1 + r × t)] – F Implied values are an important concept, one that we will return to frequently. If a trader believes that a contract is fairly priced, the implied value must represent the marketplace’s consensus estimate of the missing value. Returning to our eight-month forward contract, suppose that we believe that all values except the interest rate are accurate. What is the implied interest rate? r= =  [( F + D )/S ] − 1 t [(69.50 + 0.66)/67.00] − 1 = 0.0707 (7.07%) 8 /12  If we know all values except the dividend, the implied dividend is D = [S × (1 + r × t)] – F = [67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12)] – 69.50 = 0.18 If two dividends are expected over the life of the forward contract, the marketplace seems to expect two payments of $0.09 each. If money has been borrowed or lent at a fixed rate, there is no interest-rate risk. However, most traders borrow and lend at a variable rate, resulting in interest-rate risk over the life of the forward contract. 7  10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cDividends In order to evaluate derivative contracts on stock, a trader may be required to make an estimate of a stock’s future dividend flow. A trader will usually need to estimate the amount of the dividend and the date on which the dividend will be paid. To better understand dividends, it may be useful to define some important terms in the dividend process.  Declared Date. The date on which a company announces both the amount of the dividend and the date on which the dividend will be paid. Once the company declares the dividend, the dividend risk is eliminated, at least until the next dividend payment. Record Date. The date on which the stock must be owned in order to receive the dividend. Regardless of the date on which the stock is purchased, ownership of the stock does not become official until the settlement date, the date on which the purchaser of the stock officially takes possession. In the United States, the settlement date for stock is normally three business days after the trade is made (sometimes referred to as T + 3). Trade date  Settlement date  Ex-Dividend Date (Ex-Date). The first day on which a stock is trading without the rights to the dividend. In the United States, the last day on which a stock can be purchased in order to receive the dividend is three business days prior to the record date. The ex-dividend date is two business days prior to the record date. Ex-dividend date Trade date  (Ex-date)  Record date Two business days  Three business days  On the ex-dividend date, quotes for the stock will indicate that the stock is trading ex-div, and all quotes will be posted with the amount of the dividend deducted from the stock price. If a stock closes on the day prior to the ex-dividend date at a price of $67.50 and opens the following day (the ex-dividend date) at a price of $68.25, and the amount of the dividend is $0.40, the price of the stock will read 68.25 + 1.15 ex-div 0.40 10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cIf the stock had opened unchanged, the price would have been the previous day’s price of $67.50 less the dividend of $0.40, or $67.10. With the stock at $68.25, its price increase is $1.15.  Payable Date. The date on which the dividend will be paid to qualifying shareholders (those owning shares on the record date). The amount of the dividend can often be estimated from the company’s past dividend payments. If a company pays quarterly dividends, as is common in the United States, and has paid a dividend of 25 cents for the last 10 quarters, then it is reasonable to assume that in the future the company will continue to pay 25 cents. We have generally ignored the interest that can be earned on dividends, so it may seem that the date on which the dividend will be paid is not really important. If, however, the date on which the dividend will be paid is expected to fall close to the maturity date of a derivative contract, a slight miscalculation of the dividend date can significantly alter the value of the derivative.  Short Sales Many derivatives strategies involve buying and selling either stock or futures contracts. Except for the situation when a market is locked,8 there are no restrictions on the buying or selling of futures contracts. There are also no restrictions on the purchase of stock or on the sale of stock that is already owned. However, there may be situations in which a trader will want to sell stock short, that is, sell stock that he does not already own. The trader hopes to buy back the stock at a later date at a lower price. Depending on the exchange or local regulatory authority, there may be special rules specifying the conditions under which stock can be sold short. In all cases, however, a trader who wants to sell stock short must first borrow the stock. This is possible because many institutions that hold stock may be willing to lend out the stock to facilitate a short sale. A brokerage firm holding a client’s stock may be permitted under its agreement with the client to lend out the stock. This does not mean that one can always borrow stock. Sometimes it will be difficult or even impossible to borrow stock, resulting in a short-stock squeeze. But most actively traded stocks can be borrowed with relative ease, with the borrowing usually facilitated by the trader’s clearing firm. Consider a trader who borrows 900 shares of stock from a brokerage firm in order to sell the stock short at a price of $68 per share. The purchaser will pay the trader $68 × 900, or $61,200, and the trader will deliver the borrowed stock. The purchaser of the stock does not care whether the stock was sold short or long (whether the seller borrowed the stock or actually owned it). As far as the purchaser is concerned, he is now the owner of record of the stock. Some futures exchanges have daily price limits for futures contracts. When a futures contract reaches this limit, the market is said to be locked or locked limit. If the market is either limit up or limit down, no further trading may take place until the price comes off the limit (someone is willing to sell at a price equal to or less than the up limit or buy at a price equal to or higher than the down limit). 8  10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cBorrowed stock must eventually be returned to the lender, in this case the brokerage firm. As security against this obligation, the brokerage firm will hold the $61,200 proceeds from the sale. Because the $61,200, in theory, belongs to the trader, the firm will pay the trader interest on this amount. At the same time, the trader is obligated to pay the brokerage firm any dividends that accrue over the short-sale period. How does the brokerage firm as the lender profit from this transaction? The lending firm profits because it pays the trader only a portion of the full interest on the $61,200. The exact amount paid to the trader will depend on how difficult it is to borrow the stock. If the stock is easy to borrow, the trader may receive only slightly less than the rate he would expect to receive on any ordinary cash credit. However, if relatively few shares are available for lending, the trader may receive only a fraction of the normal rate. In the most extreme case, where the stock is very difficult to borrow, the trader may receive no interest at all. The rate that the trader receives on the short sale of stock is sometimes referred to as the short-stock rebate. We can make a distinction between the long rate rl that applies to ordinary borrowing and lending and the short rate rs that applies to the short sale of stock. The difference between the long and short rates represents the borrowing costs rbc rl – rs = rbc In a previous example we determined the forward price for a stock Stock price S = $67.00 Time to maturity t = 8 months Interest rate r = 6.00 percent Expected dividend payment D = $0.66 Ignoring interest on the dividends, the eight-month forward price is 67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 69.02 If the price of an eight-month forward contract is $69.50, there is an arbitrage opportunity by selling the forward contract and purchasing the stock. Suppose that instead the eight-month forward contract is trading at a price of $68.75. Now there seems to be an arbitrage opportunity by purchasing the forward contract and selling the stock. Indeed, if a trader already owns the stock, this will result in a profit of $69.02 – $68.75 = $0.27. If, however, the trader does not own stock and must sell the stock short in order to execute the strategy, he will not receive the full interest of 6 percent. If the lending firm will retain 2 percent in borrowing costs, the trader will only receive the short rate of 4 percent. The forward price is now 67.00 × (1 + 0.04 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 68.13 If the trader attempts to execute the arbitrage by selling the stock short, he will lose money because 68.13 – 68.75 = –0.62 10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0cA trader who does not own the stock can only profit if the forward price is less than $68.13 or more than $69.02. Between these prices, no arbitrage is possible. What interest rate should apply to option transactions? Unlike stock, an option is not a deliverable security. It is a contract that is created between a buyer and a seller. Even if a trader does not own a specific option, he need not “borrow” the option in order to sell it. For this reason, we always apply the ordinary long rate to the cash flow resulting from either the purchase or sale of an option.  10/10/14 2:22 PM  \\x0c3 Contract Specifications and Option Terminology Every option market brings together traders and investors with different expectations and goals. Some enter the market with an opinion on which direction prices will move. Some intend to use options to protect existing positions against adverse price movement. Some hope to take advantage of price discrepancies between similar or related products. Some act as middlemen, buying and selling as an accommodation to other market participants and hoping to profit from the difference between the bid price and ask price. Even though expectations and goals differ, every trader’s education must include an understanding of option contract specifications and a mastery of the terminology used in option markets. Without a clear understanding of the terms of an option contract and the rights and responsibilities under that contract, a trader cannot hope to make the best use of options, nor will he be prepared for the very real risks of trading. Without a facility in the language of options, a trader will find it impossible to communicate his desire to buy or sell in the marketplace.  Contract Specifications There are several aspects to contract specifications.  Type In Chapter 1, we introduced the two types of options. A call option is the right to buy or take a long position in an asset at a fixed price on or before a specified date. A put option is the right to sell or take a short position in an asset. Note the difference between an option and a futures contract. A futures contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The buyer and seller of a futures contract both have clearly defined obligations that they must meet. The seller must make delivery, and the buyer must take delivery. The buyer of an option, however, has a choice. He can choose to take delivery (a call) or make delivery (a put). If the buyer of an option chooses to either make or take delivery, the seller of the option is obligated to take the other side. In option trading, all rights lie with the buyer and all obligations with the seller.  Underlying The underlying asset or, more simply, the underlying is the security or commodity to be bought or sold under the terms of the option contract. If an option is purchased directly from a bank or other dealer, the quantity of the underlying can be tailored to meet the buyer’s individual requirements. If the option is purchased on an exchange, the quantity of the underlying is set by the exchange. On stock option exchanges, the underlying is typically 100 shares of stock.1 The owner of a call has the right to buy 100 shares; the owner of a put has the right to sell 100 shares. If, however, the price of an underlying stock is either very low or very high, an exchange may adjust the number of shares in the underlying contract in order to create a contract size that is deemed reasonable for trading on the exchange.2 On all futures options exchanges, the underlying is uniformly one futures contract. The owner of a call has the right to buy one futures contract; the owner of a put has the right to sell one futures contract. Most often, the underlying for an option on a futures contract is the futures month that corresponds to the expiration month of the option. The underlying for an April futures option is an April futures contract; the underlying for a November futures option is a November futures contract. However, an exchange may also choose to list serial options on futures—option expirations where there is no corresponding futures month. When a futures option has no corresponding futures month, the underlying contract is the nearest futures contract beyond expiration of the option. For example, many financial futures are listed on a quarterly cycle, with trading in March, June, September, and December futures. The underlying for a March option is a March futures contract; the underlying for a June option is a June futures contract. If there are also serial options, then The underlying for a January or February option is a March futures contract. The underlying for an April or May option is a June futures contract. The underlying for a July or August option is a September futures contract. The underlying for an October or November option is a December futures contract. Some interest-rate futures markets [e.g., Eurodollars at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Short Sterling and Euribor at the London International Financial Futures Exchange], in addition to listing long-term options on a long-term futures contract, may also list short-term options on the same One hundred shares is sometimes referred to as a round lot. An order to buy or sell fewer than 100 shares is an odd lot. 2 Many exchanges also permit trading in flex options, where the buyer and seller may negotiate the contract specifications, including the quantity of the underlying, the expiration date, the exercise price, and the exercise style. 1  10/10/14 2:27 PM  \\x0clong-term futures contract. A March futures contract maturing in two years may be the underlying for a March option expiring in two years. But the same futures contract may also be the underlying for a March option expiring in one year. Short-term options on long-term futures are listed as midcurve options. The options can be one-year midcurve (a short-term option on a futures contract with at least one year to maturity), two-year midcurve (a short-term option on a futures contract with at least two years to maturity), or five-year midcurve (a short-term option on a futures contract with at least five years to maturity).  Expiration Date or Expiry The expiration date is the date on which the owner of an option must make the final decision whether to buy, in the case of a call, or to sell, in the case of a put. After expiration, all rights and obligations under the option contract cease to exist. On many stock option exchanges, the expiration date for stock and stock index options is the third Friday of the expiration month.3 Of more importance to most traders is the last trading day, the last business day prior to expiration on which an option can be bought or sold on an exchange. For most stock options, expiration day and the last trading day are the same, the third Friday of the month. However, Good Friday, a legal holiday in many countries, occasionally falls on the third Friday of April. When this occurs, the last trading day is the preceding Thursday. When stock options were introduced in the United States, trading in expiring contracts ended at the close of business on the third Friday of the month. However, many derivative strategies require carrying an offsetting stock position to expiration, at which time the stock position is liquidated. Consequently, stock exchanges found that as the close of trading approached on expiration Friday, they were faced with large orders to buy or sell stock. These large orders often had the effect of disrupting trading or distorting prices at expiration. To alleviate the problem of large order imbalances at expiration, some derivative exchanges, working with the stock exchanges on which the underlying stocks were traded, agreed to establish an expiration value for a derivatives contract based on the opening price of the underlying contract rather than the closing price on the last trading day. This AM expiration is commonly used for stock index contracts. Options on individual stocks are still subject to the traditional PM expiration, where the value of an option is determined by the underlying stock price at the close of trading on the last trading day. Although the expiration date for stock options is relatively uniform, the expiration date for futures options can vary, depending on the underlying commodity or financial instrument. For futures on physical commodities, such as agricultural or energy products, delivery at maturity may take several days. As a consequence, options on futures for physical commodities will often expire several days or even weeks prior to the maturity of the futures contract, most commonly in the month prior to the futures month. An option on a March futures contract will expire in February; an option on a July futures contract will In the early days of option trading, exchange-traded options often expired on a nonbusiness day, typically on a Saturday. This gave the exchange an extra day to process the paperwork associated with expiring options. 3  10/10/14 2:27 PM  \\x0cexpire in June; an option on a November futures contract will expire in October. A trader will need to consult the exchange calendar to determine the exact expiration date, which is set by each individual exchange.  Exercise Price or Strike Price The exercise or strike price is the price at which the underlying will be delivered should the holder of an option choose to exercise his right to buy or sell. If the option is exercised, the owner of a call will pay the exercise price; the owner of a put will receive the exercise price. The exercise prices available for trading on an option exchange are set by the exchange, usually at equal intervals and bracketing the current price of the underlying contract. If the price of the underlying contract is 62 when options are introduced, the exchange may set exercise prices of 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and 75. At a later date, as the price of the underlying moves up or down, the exchange can add additional exercise prices. If the price of the underlying rises to 70, the exchange may add exercise prices of 80, 85, and 90. Additionally, if the exchange feels that it will further facilitate trading, it can introduce intermediate exercise prices—52½, 57½, 62½, 67½. As an example of an exchange-traded option, the buyer of a crude oil October 90 call on the New York Mercantile Exchange has the right to take a long position in one October crude oil futures contract for 1,000 barrels of crude oil (the underlying) at a price of $90 per barrel (the exercise price) on or before the October expiration (the expiration date). The buyer of a General Electric March 30 put on the Chicago Board Options Exchange has the right to take a short position in 100 shares of General Electric stock (the underlying) at a price of $30 per share (the exercise price) on or before March expiration (the expiration date). Option contract specifications are further outlined in Figure 3-1.  Exercise and Assignment The buyer of a call or a put option has the right to exercise that option prior to its expiration date, thereby converting the option into a long underlying position in the case of a call or a short underlying position in the case of a put. A trader who exercises a crude oil October 90 call has chosen to take a long position in one October crude oil futures contract at $90 per barrel. A trader who Figure 3-1\\u2002Option contract specifications. Crude Oil  October  90  Call  underlying contract  expiration date  exercise price  type  GE  March  30  Put  10/10/14 2:27 PM  \\x0cexercises a GE March 30 put has chosen to take a short position in 100 shares of GE stock at $30 per share. Once an option is exercised, the rights and obligations associated with the option cease to exist, just as if the option had been allowed to expire. A trader who intends to exercise an option must submit an exercise notice to either the seller of the option, if purchased from a dealer, or to the exchange, if the option was purchased on an exchange. When a valid exercise notice is submitted, the seller of the option has been assigned. Depending on the type of option, the seller will be required to take a long or short position in the underlying contract at the option’s exercise price. Once a contract has been traded on an exchange, the link between buyer and seller is broken, with the exchange becoming the counterparty to all trades. Still, when a trader exercises an option, the exchange must assign someone to either buy or sell the underlying contract at the exercise price. How does the exchange make this decision? The party who is assigned must be someone who has sold the option and has not closed out the position through an offsetting trade. Beyond this, the exchange’s decision on who will be assigned is essentially random, with no trader having either a greater or lesser probability of being assigned. New traders sometimes become confused about whether the exercise and assignment result in a long position (buying the underlying contract) or a short position (selling the underlying contract). The following summary may help: if you Exercise a call\\t\\t You choose to buy at the exercise price. Are assigned on a call You are required to sell at the exercise price.

Cash Settlement into the Physical Underlying If a call option settles into the physical underlying, the exerciser pays the exercise price and in return receives the underlying. If a put option settles into the physical underlying, the exerciser receives the exercise price and in return must deliver the underlying. Stock options always settle into the physical underlying. You exercise one January 110 call on stock. You must pay 100 × $110 = $11,000. You receive 100 shares of stock. You are assigned on six April 40 calls on stock. You receive 600 × $40 = $24,000. You must deliver 600 shares of stock. 10/10/14 2:27 PM  \\x0cYou exercise two July 60 puts on stock. You receive 200 × $60 = $12,000. You must deliver 200 shares of stock. You are assigned on three October 95 puts on stock. You must pay 300 × $95 = $28,500. You receive 300 shares of stock. Note that the cash flow resulting from settlement into the physical underlying depends only on the exercise price. In our examples, whether the price of the stock at exercise is $10 or $1,000, the exerciser of a call pays only the exercise price, not the stock price. The exerciser of a put receives only the exercise price. Of course, the profit or loss resulting from the option trade will depend on both the stock price and the price originally paid for the option. But the cash flow when the option is exercised is independent of these. Settlement into a Futures Position If an option settles into a futures position, it is just as if the exerciser is buying or selling the futures contract at the exercise price. The position is immediately subject to futures-type settlement, requiring a margin deposit and accompanied by a variation payment. An underlying futures contract is currently trading at 85.00 with a point value of $1,000. Margin requirements are $3,000 per contract. You exercise one February 80 call. You immediately become long one futures contract at a price of 80. You must deposit with the exchange the required margin of $3,000. You will receive a variation credit of (85 – 80) × $1,000 = $5,000. You are assigned on six May 75 calls. You immediately become short six futures contracts at a price of 75. You must deposit with the exchange the required margin of 6 × $3,000 = $18,000. You will have a variation debit of (75 – 85) × $1,000 × 6 = –$60,000 You exercise four August 100 puts. You immediately become short four futures contracts at a price of 100. You must deposit with the exchange the required margin of 4 × $3,000 = $12,000. You will receive a variation credit of (100 – 85) × $1,000 × 4 = $60,000. You are assigned on two November 95 puts. You immediately become long two futures contracts at a price of 95. You must deposit with the exchange the required margin of 2 × $3,000 = $6,000. You will have a variation debit of (85 – 95) × $1,000 × 2 = –$20,000. Settlement into Cash This type of settlement is used primarily for index contracts where delivery of the underlying contract is not practical. If exercise of an option settles into cash, no underlying position results. There is a cash payment equal to the difference between the exercise price and the underlying price at the end of the trading day. 10/10/14 2:27 PM  \\x0cAn underlying index is fixed at the end of the trading day at 300. The exchange has assigned a value of $500 to each index point. You exercise three March 250 calls. You have no underlying position. Your account will be credited with (300 – 250) × $500 × 3 = $75,000. You are assigned on seven June 275 calls. You have no underlying position. Your account will be debited by (275 – 300) × $500 × 7 = $87,500. You exercise two September 320 puts. You have no underlying position. Your account will be credited with (320 – 300) × $500 × 2 = $20,000. You are assigned on four December 340 puts. You have no underlying position. Your account will be debited by (300 – 340) × $500 × 4 = $80,000.  Exercise Style In addition to the underlying contract, exercise price, expiration date, and type, an option is further identified by its exercise style, either European or American. A European option can only be exercised at expiration. In practice, this means that the holder of a European option must make the final decision whether to exercise or not on the last business day prior to expiration. In contrast, an American option can be exercised on any business day prior to expiration. The designation of an option’s exercise style as either European or American has nothing to do with geographic location. Many options traded in the United States are European, and many options traded in Europe are American.4 Generally, options on futures and options on individual stocks tend to be American. Options on indexes tend to be European.  Option Price Components As in any competitive market, an option’s price, or premium, is determined by supply and demand. Buyers and sellers make competitive bids and offers in the marketplace. When a bid and offer coincide, a trade is made. The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components— the intrinsic value and the time value. An option has intrinsic value if it enables the holder of the option to buy low and sell high or sell high and buy low, with the intrinsic value being equal to the difference between the buying price and the selling price. With an underlying contract trading at $435, the intrinsic value of a 400 call is $35. By exercising the option, the holder of the 400 call can buy at $400. If he then sells at the market price of $435, $35 will be credited to his account. With an underlying contract trading at $62, the intrinsic value of a 70 It does appear that the first options traded in the United States carried with them the right of early exercise— hence the term American option. 4  10/10/14 2:27 PM  \\x0cput is $8. By exercising the option, the holder of the put can sell at $70. If he then buys at the market price of $62, he will show a total credit of $8. A call will only have intrinsic value if its exercise price is less than the current market price of the underlying contract because no one would choose to buy high and sell low. A put will only have intrinsic value if its exercise price is greater than the current market price of the underlying contract because no one would choose to sell low and buy high. The amount of intrinsic value is the amount by which the exercise price is less than the current underlying price in the case of a call or the amount by which the exercise price is greater than the current underlying price in the case of a put. No option can have an intrinsic value less than zero. If S is the spot price of the underlying contract and X is the exercise price, then Call intrinsic value = maximum of either 0 or S – X. Put intrinsic value = maximum of either 0 or X – S. Note that the intrinsic value is independent of the expiration date. With the underlying contract at $83, a March 70 call and a September 70 call both have an intrinsic value of $13. A June 90 put and a December 90 put both have an intrinsic value of $7. Usually, an option’s price in the marketplace will be greater than its intrinsic value. The time value, sometimes also referred to as the option’s time premium or extrinsic value, is the additional amount of premium beyond the intrinsic value that traders are willing to pay for an option. Market participants are willing to pay this additional amount primarily because of the protective characteristics afforded by an option over an outright long or short position in the underlying contract. An option’s premium is always composed of precisely its intrinsic value and its time value. Examples of intrinsic value and time value are shown in Figure 3-2. If a $400 call is trading at $50 with the underlying trading at $435, the time value of the call must be $15 because the intrinsic value is $35. The two components must add up to the option’s total premium of $50. If a $70 put on a stock is trading for $11 with the stock trading at $62, the time value of the put must be $3 because the intrinsic value is $8. Again, the intrinsic value and the time value must add up to the option’s premium of $11. Even though an option’s premium is always composed of its intrinsic value and its time value, one or both of these components can be zero. If the option has no intrinsic value, its price in the marketplace will consist solely of time value. If the option has no time value, its price will consist solely of intrinsic value. In the latter case, traders say that the option is trading at parity. Although an option’s intrinsic value can never be less than zero, it is possible for a European option to have a negative time value. (More about this in Chapter 16 when we look at the early exercise of American options.) When this happens, the option can trade for less than parity. Usually, however, an option’s premium will reflect some nonnegative amount of time value.  In the Money, At the Money, and Out of the Money Depending on the relationship between an option’s exercise price and the price of the underlying contract, options are said to be in the money, at the 10/10/14 2:27 PM  \\x0cFigure 3-2\\u2002Intrinsic value and time value.

Any option that has a positive intrinsic value is said to be in the money by the amount of the intrinsic value. With a stock at $44, a $40 call is in the money by $4. A $55 put on the same stock is in the money by $11. An option with no intrinsic value is said to be out of the money, and its price consists solely of time value. In order to be in the money, a call must have an exercise price lower than the current price of the underlying contract, and a put must have an exercise price higher than the current price of the underlying contract. Note that if a call is in the money, a put with the same exercise price and underlying contract must be out of the money. Conversely, if the put is in the money, a call with the same exercise price must be out of the money. In our examples with the stock at $44, the $40 put is out of the money by $4 and the $55 call is out of the money by $11. Finally, an option whose exercise price is equal to the current price of the underlying contract is said to be at the money. Technically, such an option is also out of the money because it has no intrinsic value. Traders make the distinction between at-the-money and out-of-the-money options because, as we shall see, at-the-money options often have very specific and desirable characteristics, and such options tend to be the most actively traded. If we want to be very precise, for an option to be at the money, its exercise price must be exactly equal to the current price of the underlying contract. However, for exchange-traded options, the term is commonly applied to the call and put whose exercise price is closest to the current price of the underlying contract. With a stock at $74 and $5 between exercise prices ($65, $70, $75, $80, etc.), the $75 call and the $75 put are the at-the-money options. These are the call and put options with exercise prices closest to the current price of the underlying contract. In-, at-, and out-of-the-money options are outlined in Figure 3-3. 10/10/14 2:27 PM  \\x0cFigure 3-3\\u2002In-, at-, and out-of-the-money options. Current underlying price In-the-money calls  Out-of-the-money calls  Lower exercise prices  Higher exercise prices  Out-of-the-money puts  In-the-money puts  At-the-money calls and puts  Automatic Exercise At expiration an in-the-money option will always have some intrinsic value. A trader can capture this value by either selling the option in the marketplace prior to expiration or exercising the option and immediately closing the underlying position. When exchange-traded options were first introduced, anyone wishing to exercise an option was required to formally submit an exercise notice to the exchange. If someone forgot to submit an exercise notice for an in-the-money option, the option would expire unexercised, and the trader would lose the intrinsic value. This is an outcome that no rational person would accept. Unfortunately, in the early days of option trading, this occurred occasionally for various reasons: perhaps the trader was unaware that he was required to submit an exercise notice, perhaps the trader was out of communication with the exchange and was therefore unable to submit an exercise notice, or perhaps there was an error on the part of the clearing firm in processing the exercise notice. To avoid a situation where an in-the-money option expires unexercised, which would be an embarrassment to both the individual trader and the exchange, most exchanges have instituted an automatic exercise policy. The exchange will exercise on behalf of the option holder any in-the-money option at expiration, even if an exercise notice has not been submitted. The criteria for automatic exercise may vary from one exchange to another and may also vary depending on who holds the option. For example, because of transaction costs, it may not be economically worthwhile to exercise an option that is only very slightly in the money. Therefore, the exchange may automatically exercise only options that are in the money by some predetermined amount. If the automatic exercise threshold is 0.05, then an option must be in the money by at least 0.05 in order for the exchange to exercise the option. If the option is in the money by 0.03, a trader may still exercise the option but must do so by submitting an exercise notice. On the opposite side, if the option is in the money by 0.06, a trader who feels that the option is not worth exercising may submit a do not exercise notice. Otherwise, the exchange will automatically exercise the option on the trader’s behalf. Because professional traders and retail customers have different cost structures, the exchange may have a different automatic exercise threshold for 10/10/14 2:27 PM  \\x0ceach party. The threshold may be 0.05 for retail customers but only 0.02 for professionals. To determine who is a professional trader and who is not, an exchange will usually specify the criteria necessary for inclusion in each category.  Option Margining Depending on the exchange and the type of underlying contract, options can be subject to either stock-type settlement or futures-type settlement. However, once an option trade is made, there are additional risks that the clearinghouse must consider. Is the risk to an option position limited or unlimited? If unlimited, how should the clearinghouse protect itself ? When the risk of an option position is limited, the margin that must be deposited with the clearinghouse will never be greater than the maximum risk to the position. The buyer of an option can never have risk greater than the premium paid for the option, and the clearinghouse will never require a margin deposit greater than this amount. Even if an option position is very complex, as long as there is a maximum risk to the position, there will also be a maximum margin requirement. Some option positions, however, have unlimited risk. For such positions, the clearinghouse must consider the risk associated with a wide variety of outcomes. Once this is done, the clearinghouse can require a margin deposit commensurate with the perceived risk of the position. Unlike futures margining, where the clearinghouse sets a fixed margin deposit for each open futures position, there is no single method of determining the margin for a complex option position. However, all methods are risk-based, requiring an analysis of the position’s risk under a broad range of market conditions. In the United States, the Options Clearing Corporation has developed its own risked-based margining system for stock and index options. The most widely used margining system on futures exchanges is the Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) system developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Both margining systems create an array of possible outcomes with respect to both the underlying price and the perceived speed with which the underlying price can change. The clearinghouse then uses this array to determine a reasonable margin requirement.5  A description of SPAN margining can be found at http://www.cmegroup.com/clearing/risk-management. A description of the risk-based margining system used by the Options Clearing Corporation can be found at http:// www.optionsclearing.com/risk-management/margins/. 5  36\\tOP T ION  V OLA T ILI T Y AND PRI C ING  \\x0c4 Expiration Profit and Loss The trader who enters an option market for the first time may find himself subjected to a form of contract shock. Unlike a trader in equities or futures, whose choices are limited to a small number of instruments, an option trader must often deal with a bewildering assortment of contracts. With several expiration months, with multiple exercise prices available in each month, and with both calls and puts at each exercise price, it is not unusual for an option trader to be faced with what at first seems like an overwhelming number of different contracts. With so many choices available, a trader needs some logical method of deciding which options actually represent profit opportunities. Which should he buy? Which should he sell? Which should he avoid? The choices are so numerous that a prospective option trader might be inclined to give up in frustration. To begin, a trader might ask a very obvious question: what is an option worth? The question may be obvious, but the answer, unfortunately, is not, because option prices can be affected by many different market forces. However, there is one time in an option’s life when everyone ought to be able to agree on the option’s value. At expiration, an option is worth exactly its intrinsic value: zero if it is out of the money or the difference between the underlying price and the exercise price if it is in the money. Following is a series of underlying prices and the value at expiration for two options, a $95 call and $110 put: Underlying Price  95 Call  110 Put  80  0  30  85  0  25  90  0  20  95  0  15  100  5  10 Underlying Price  95 Call  110 Put  105  10  5  110  15  0  115  20  0  120  25  0  125  30  0  For the 95 call, if the underlying price at expiration is 95 or below, the call is out of the money and therefore worthless. If, however, the underlying price rises above 95, the 95 call will go into the money, gaining one point in value for each point that the underlying price rises above 95. For the 110 put, if the underlying price is 110 or above, the put is out of the money and therefore worthless. But if the underlying price falls below 110, the 110 put goes into the money, gaining one point in value for each point decline in the underlying price.  Parity Graphs For someone who has bought an option, the intrinsic value represents a credit, or positive value. The buyer of the option will be able to buy low and sell high. For someone who has sold an option, the intrinsic value represents a debit, or negative value. The seller of the option will be forced to buy high and sell low. We can use an option’s intrinsic value to draw a graph of the value of an option position at expiration as a function of the price of the underlying contract. Figure 4-1 shows such a graph for a long call position. Below the exercise price, the option has no value. Above the exercise price, the option gains one point in value for each point increase in the underlying price.  Position value  Figure 4-1 Long call.  38  Exercise price  +1 +1  0 Lower underlying prices  Higher underlying prices  Position value  Figure 4-2\\u2002Short call.  Lower underlying prices  Higher underlying prices  0  Exercise price  +1 –1  Figure 4-2 shows the value of a short call position at expiration. Now, if the option is in the money, the value of the position is negative. For every point the underlying rises above the exercise price, the position loses one point in value. We can create the same type of expiration graphs for long and short put positions, as shown in Figures 4-3 and 4-4. For a long or short put, the value of the position is zero if the underlying price is above the exercise price. For a long put, the position gains one point for each point decline in the underlying price. For a short put, the position loses one point in value for each point decline in the underlying price. A parity graph represents the value of an option position at expiration, parity being another name for intrinsic value. Because of their shapes, traders Figure 4-3 Long put.  Position value  +1 –1  Exercise price  0 Lower underlying prices  Higher underlying prices  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cPosition value  Figure 4-4\\u2002Short put.  Lower underlying prices  Higher underlying prices  0 –1 –1  Exercise price  sometimes refer to the four basic parity graphs (long and short call and long and short put) as the hockey-stick diagrams. The four basic parity graphs highlight one of the most important characteristics of option trading. Buyers of options have limited risk (they can never lose more than the price of the option) and unlimited profit potential. Sellers of options have limited profit potential (they can never make more than the price of the option) and unlimited risk.1 Given the apparently unbalanced risk-reward tradeoff, new option traders tend to have the same reaction: why would anyone do anything other than buy options? The purchase of an option results in a position with limited risk and unlimited profit, which certainly seems more desirable than the limited profit and unlimited risk that result from the sale of an option. Yet, in every option market, there are traders who are willing to sell options. Why are they willing to do this in the face of this apparently unbalanced risk-reward tradeoff? The answer has to do with not just the best and worst that can happen but also with the likelihood of those occurrences. It’s true that someone who sells an option is exposed to unlimited risk, but if the amount received for the option is great enough and the perceived risk is low enough, a trader might be willing to take that risk. In later chapters we will see the very important role probability plays in option pricing.  Slope From the parity graphs, we can see that if an option is out of the money, its value is unaffected by changes in the price of the underlying contract. If the option is in the money, it will either gain or lose value as the underlying price changes. Admittedly, in traditional stock and commodity markets, a put does not represent unlimited profit potential to the buyer nor unlimited risk to the seller because the underlying contract cannot fall below zero. But for practical purposes most traders think of both calls and puts as having unlimited potential value. 1  40  The slope of the graph is the change in value of the option position with respect to changes in the price of the underlying contract, often expressed as a fraction slope =  change in position value change in underlying price  We can summarize the slopes of the basic positions as follows: Position  Slope  Long or short any out-of-the-money option  0  Long an in-the-money call  +1  Short an in-the-money call  –1  Long an in-the-money put  –1  Short an in-the-money put  +1  In addition to parity graphs for individual options, we can also create parity graphs for positions consisting of multiple options by adding up the slopes of the individual options. Figure 4-5 is the parity graph of a position consisting of a long call and long put at the same exercise price. We can calculate the total slopes as follows: Below the exercise price  Call is out of the money  Slope  0  Put is in the money  –1  Total slope below the exercise price  –1  Above the exercise price  Slope  Put is out of the money  0  Call is in the money  +1  Total slope above the exercise price  +1  The combined position will gain value if the underlying price moves in either direction away from the exercise price. The position is typical of many option strategies that may be sensitive to the magnitude of movement in the underlying contract rather than the direction of movement. Many option strategies involve combining options with the underlying contract, so we will also want to consider the slope of an underlying position. As shown in Figure 4-6, the slope of a long underlying position is always +1, and the slope of a short underlying position is always –1. The slopes are constant regardless of the underlying price. This is an important distinction between an option position and an underlying position.

Figure 4-7 shows the parity graph of a position that combines two long call options at the same exercise price and with a short underlying contract. Below the exercise price, the total slope is –1 (0 for the out-of-the-money calls, –1 for the short underlying). Above the exercise price, the total slope is +1 (+2 for the in-the-money calls, –1 for the short underlying contract). This parity graph is identical to the position in Figure 4-5, which must mean that the same option strategy can be constructed in more than one way. This is an important characteristic of options that we will look at in more detail in Chapter 14. Note also that the location of the underlying position is irrelevant to the parity graph. Regardless of the price of the underlying, the slope is always either +1 for a long underlying position or –1 for a short underlying position.

Above the exercise price, the total slope is also +1 (+1 for the in-the-money call, 0 for the out-of-themoney put). The slope of the entire position is always +1, exactly the same as a long underlying contract. If a position consists of many different contracts, including underlying contracts and calls and puts over a wide range of exercise prices, the parity graph for the position may be quite complex. But the procedure for constructing the graph is always the same: determine the slopes of the graph below the lowest exercise price, above the highest exercise price, and between all the intermediate exercise prices, and then connect all the line segments.

To determine the slopes of a complex position, it may be helpful to construct a table showing the slopes of the individual contracts over all intervals. We can then add up the individual slopes to get the total slope over each interval.

Nevertheless, the parity graph tells us something about the characteristics of the position. Here we can see that the potential profit on the downside, as well as the potential loss on the upside, is unlimited.  Expiration Profit and Loss A parity graph may tell us the characteristics of an option position at expiration, but an equally important consideration will be the profit or loss that results from the position. Whether the position makes or loses money will depend on the prices at which the contracts are bought and sold. The purchase of options will create a debit, whereas the sale of options will create a credit. For a simple option position, the expiration profit and loss (P&L) graph will be the parity graph shifted downward by the amount of any debit or upward by the amount of any credit. Consider the following option prices with the underlying contract trading at a price of 98.00: 85  90  95  100  105  110  115  Calls  14.25  9.75  6.25  3.50  1.75  0.75  0.25  Puts  0.25  1.00  2.25  4.50  7.75  11.75  16.25  Figure 4-10 shows the parity graph of a long 100 call position. If the option is purchased at a price of 3.50, we can construct the expiration P&L Figure 4-10 Long a 100 call at a price of 3.50. Parity graph  Profit or loss at expiration  Expiration P&L graph  46  100  0 –3.50  +1 +1  Breakeven 103.50  graph by shifting the entire parity graph down by this amount. If the underlying is anywhere below 100 at expiration, the option will be worthless, and the position will lose 3.50. With the underlying above 100, the slope of the graph is +1; the option will gain one point in value for each point increase in the price of the underlying. We can also see that there is a breakeven price at which the option position will be worth exactly 3.50. Logically, this must occur at an underlying price of 103.50. Figure 4-11 shows the parity graph of a short 95 put position. If the option is sold at a price of 2.25, we can construct the expiration P&L graph by shifting the entire graph up by this amount. With an underlying price anywhere above 95 at expiration, the option will be worthless, and the position will show a profit of 2.25. With an underlying price below 95, the slope of the graph is +1; the position will lose one point for each point decline in the price of the underlying. The breakeven price for the position is 92.75, the price at which the 95 put will be worth exactly 2.25. The relative expiration value of long option positions at different exercise prices—95, 100, and 105—is shown in Figure 4-12. The same relative value for long put positions is shown in Figure 4-13. Calls with lower exercise prices have greater values (i.e., they enable the holder to buy at a lower price), whereas puts with higher exercise prices have greater values (i.e., they enable the holder to sell at a higher price). For more complex positions, it may not be immediately clear whether the position will result in a credit or debit. In this case, we can construct an expiration P&L graph by first determining the slopes of the graph over all the intervals. Then we can calculate the P&L at one point, and from this one P&L point, we can use the slopes to determine the P&L at all other points.  Figure 4-11\\u2002Short a 95 put at a price of 2.25.

Below 95, the slope of the graph is 0, so the P&L is always –3.00. Between 95 and 105, the slope is +1, so the P&L at 105 (10 points higher) is –3.00 + 10.00 = +7.00. Above 105, the slope is –2, with the position losing one point for each point increase in the price of the underlying. The position has two breakeven prices, one between 95 and 105 and one above 105. With a P&L of –3.00 at 95 and a slope of +1 between 95 and 105, the first breakeven is 95.00 + (3.00/1) = 98.00  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cFigure 4-14 +1 95 call –6.25 –1 105 call –1.75 –2 105 puts –7.75 –2 underlying contracts –98.00  Profit or loss at expiration  +7.00  Breakeven 108.50  Breakeven 98.00  0 +1  +1  +1  –3.00  –2  95  105  With a P&L of +7.00 at 105 and a slope above 105 of –2, the second breakeven is 105.00 + (7.00/2) = 108.50 Finally, let’s go back to the parity-graph position shown in Figure 4-9. Suppose that we are told that at expiration with an underlying price of 62.00 the position will show a profit of 2.10. What will be the P&L at expiration if the underlying price is 81.50? Using the slopes, we can work our way from 62.00 to 81.50 Interval  50  Beginning P&L  Slope  Ending P&L  62.00–65.00  +2.10  –3  +2.10 – (3 × 3) = –6.90  65.00–70.00  –6.90  +2  –6.90 + (2 × 5) = +3.50  70.00–75.00  +3.10  0  +3.50  75.00–80.00  +3.10  –3  +3.50 – (3 × 5) = –11.90  80.00–81.50  –11.90  –1  –11.90 – (1 × 1.50) = –13.40  At an underlying price of 81.50, the position will show a loss of 13.40. We can also see that there are three breakeven prices for the position: Between 62.00 and 65.00 Between 65.00 and 70.00 Between 75.00 and 80.00  62.00 + 2.10/3 = 62.70 65.00 + 6.90/2 = 68.45 75.00 + 3.10/3 ≈ 76.03  All critical points for the position are shown in Figure 4-15.

From the expiration profit and loss (P&L) graphs, we can see clearly that the direction in which an underlying contract moves can be an important consideration in choosing an option strategy. A trader who believes that the underlying market will rise will be more inclined either to buy calls or sell puts. A trader who believes that the underlying market will fall will be more inclined either to buy puts or sell calls. In each case, the directional movement in the underlying market will increase the likelihood that the strategy will be profitable. However, an option trader has an additional problem that we might call the “speed” of the market. If we ignore interest and dividend considerations, a trader who believes that a stock will rise in price within a specified period can be reasonably certain of making a profit if he is right. He can simply buy the stock, wait for it to reach his target price, and then sell the stock at a profit. The situation is not quite so simple for an option trader. Suppose that a trader believes that a stock will rise in price from $100, its present price, to $115 within the next five months. Suppose also that a $110 call expiring in three months is available at a price of $2. If the stock rises to $115 by expiration, the purchase of the $110 call will result in a profit of $3 ($5 intrinsic value minus the $2 cost of the option). But is this profit a certainty? What will happen if the price of the stock remains below $110 for the next three months and only reaches $115 after the option expires? Then the option will expire worthless, and the trader will lose his $2 investment. Perhaps the trader would do better to purchase a $110 call that expires in six months rather than three months. Now he can be certain that when the stock reaches $115, the call will be worth at least $5 in intrinsic value. But what if the price of the six-month option is $6? In this case, the trader still might show a loss. Even if the underlying stock reaches the target price of $115, there is no guarantee that the $110 call will ever be worth more than its $5 intrinsic value. A trader in an underlying market is interested almost exclusively in the direction in which the market will move. Although an option trader is also sensitive to directional considerations, he must also give some thought to how fast the market is likely to move. If a trader in the underlying stock and an option trader in the same market take long market positions in their respective instruments and the market does in fact move higher, the stock trader is assured of a profit, while the option trader may show a loss. If the market fails to move sufficiently fast, the favorable directional move may not be enough to offset the option’s loss in time value. A speculator will often buy options for their seemingly favorable risk-reward characteristics (limited risk, unlimited reward), but if he purchases options, not only must he be right about market direction, he must also be right about market speed. Only if he is right on both counts can he expect to make a profit. If predicting the correct market direction is difficult, correctly predicting direction and speed is probably beyond most traders’ capabilities. The concept of speed is crucial in trading options. Indeed, many option strategies depend only on the speed of the underlying market and not at all on its direction. If a trader is highly proficient at predicting directional moves in the underlying market, he is probably better advised to trade the underlying instrument. Only when a trader has some feel for the speed component can he hope to successfully enter the option market.  The Importance of Probability One can never be certain about future market conditions, so almost all trading decisions are based on some estimate of probability. We often express our opinions about probability using words such as likely, good chance, possible, and probable. But in an option evaluation we need to be more specific. We need to define probability in way that will enable us to do the types of calculations required to make intelligent decisions in the marketplace. If we can do this, we will find that probability and the choice of strategy go hand in hand. If a trader believes that a strategy has a very high probability of profit and a very low probability of loss, he will be satisfied with a small potential profit because the profit is likely to be quite secure. On the other hand, if the probability of profit is very low, the trader will demand a large profit when market conditions develop favorably. Because of the importance of probability in the decision-making process, it will be worthwhile to consider some simple probability concepts.  Expected Value Suppose that we are given the opportunity to roll a six-sided die, and each time we roll, we will be paid a dollar amount equal to the number that comes up. If we roll a one, we are paid $1; if we roll a two, we are paid $2; and so on up to six, in which case we are paid $6. If we are given the opportunity to roll the die an infinite number of times, on average, how much do we expect to receive per roll? We can calculate the answer using some simple arithmetic. There are six possible numbers, each with equal probability. If we add up the six possible outcomes 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 and divide this by the six faces on the die, 10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cwe get 21/6 = 3½. That is, on average, we can expect to get back $3½ each time we roll the die. This is the average payback, or expected value. If we must pay for the privilege of rolling the die, what is a reasonable price? If we purchase the chance to roll the die for less than $3½, in the long run, we expect to show a profit. If we pay more than $3½, in the long run, we expect to show a loss. And if we pay exactly $3½, we expect to break even. Note the qualifying phrase in the long run. The expected value of $3½ is realistic only if we are allowed to roll the die many, many times. If we are allowed to roll only once, we cannot be certain of getting back $3½. Indeed, on any one roll, it is impossible to get back $3½ because no face of the die has exactly 3½ spots. Nevertheless, if we pay less than $3½ for even one roll of the die, the laws of probability are on our side because we have paid less than the expected value. In a similar vein, consider a roulette bet. The roulette wheel has 38 slots, numbers 1 through 36 and 0 and 00.1 Suppose that a casino allows a player to choose a number. If the player’s number comes up, he receives $36; if any other number comes up, he receives nothing. What is the expected value for this proposition? There are 38 slots on the roulette wheel, each with equal probability, but only one slot will return $36 to the player. If we divide the one outcome where the player wins $36 by the 38 slots on the wheel, the result is $36/38 = $0.9474, or about 95 cents. A player who pays 95 cents for the privilege of picking a number at the roulette table can expect to approximately break even in the long run. Of course, no casino will let a player buy such a bet for 95 cents. Under those conditions, the casino would make no profit. In the real world, a player who wants to purchase such a bet will have to pay more than the expected return, typically $1. The 5-cent difference between the $1 price of the bet and the 95-cent expected value represents the profit potential, or edge, to the casino. In the long run, for every dollar bet at the roulette table, the casino can expect to keep about 5 cents. Given the preceding conditions, any player interested in making a profit would rather switch places with the casino. Then he would have a 5-cent edge on his side by selling bets worth 95 cents for $1. Alternatively, the player would like to find a casino where he could purchase the bet for less than its expected value of 95 cents, perhaps 88 cents. Then the player would have a 7-cent edge over the casino.  Theoretical Value The theoretical value of a proposition is the price one would be willing to pay now to just break even in the long run. Thus far, the only factor we have considered in determining the value of a proposition is the expected value. We used this concept to calculate the 95-cent fair price for the roulette bet. Suppose that in our roulette example the casino decides to change the conditions slightly. The player may now purchase the roulette bet for its expected value of 95 cents, and as before, if he loses, the casino will immediately collect We assume a roulette wheel with 38 slots, as is customary in the United States. In some parts of the world, a roulette wheel may have no slot numbered 00. This, of course, changes the probabilities. 1  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0chis 95 cents. Under the new conditions, however, if the player wins, the casino will send him his $36 winnings in two months. Will both the player and the casino still break even on the proposition? Where did the player get the 95 cents that he bet at the roulette wheel? In the immediate sense, he may have taken it out of his pocket. But a closer examination may reveal that he withdrew the money from his bank prior to visiting the casino. Because he won’t receive his winnings for two months, he will have to take into consideration the two months of interest he would have earned had he left the 95 cents in the bank. The theoretical value of the bet is really the present value of its expected value, the 95 cents expected value discounted by interest. If interest rates are 12 percent annually, the theoretical value is 95 cents/(1 + 0.12 × 2/12) ≈ 93 cents Even if the player purchases the bet for its expected return of 95 cents, he will still lose 2 cents because of the interest that he could have earned for two months if he had left his money in the bank. The casino, on the other hand, will take the 95 cents, put it in an interest-bearing account, and at the end of two months collect 2 cents in interest. Under the new conditions, if a player pays 93 cents for the roulette bet today and receives his winnings in two months, neither he nor the casino can expect to make any profit in the long run. The two most common considerations in option evaluation are the expected return and interest. There may, however, be other considerations. Suppose that the player is a good client, and the casino decides to send him a 1-cent bonus a month from now. He can add this additional payment to the previous theoretical value of 93 cents to get a new theoretical value of 94 cents. This is similar to the dividend paid to owners of stock in a company. In fact, dividends can be an additional consideration in evaluating both stock and options on stock. If a casino is selling roulette bets that have an expected value of 95 cents for a price of $1, does this guarantee that the casino will make a profit? It does if the casino can be certain of staying in business for the “long run” because over long periods of time the good and bad luck will tend to even out. Unfortunately, before the casino reaches the long run, it must survive the short run. It’s possible that someone can walk up to the roulette wheel, make a series of bets, and have their number come up 20 times in succession. Clearly, this is very unlikely, but the laws of probability say that it could happen. If the player’s good luck results in the casino going out of business, the casino will never reach the long run. The goal of option evaluation is to determine, through the use of a theoretical pricing model, the theoretical value of an option. The trader can then make an intelligent decision whether the price of the option in the marketplace is either too low or too high and whether the theoretical edge is sufficient to justify making a trade. But determining the theoretical value is only half the problem. Because an option’s theoretical value is based on the laws of probability, which are only reliable in the long run, the trader must also consider the question of risk. Even if a trader has correctly calculated an option’s theoretical value, how will he control the short-term bad luck that goes with any probability calculation? We shall see that in the real world, an option’s theoretical value 10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cis always open to question. For this reason, a trader’s ability to manage risk is at least as important as his ability to calculate a theoretical value.  A Word on Models What is a model? We can think of a model as a scaled-down or more easily managed representation of the real world. The model may be a physical one, such as a model airplane or architectural model, or it may be a mathematical one, such as a formula. In each case, we use the model to better understand the world around us. However, it is unwise, and sometimes dangerous, to assume that the model and the real world that it represents are identical in every way. We may have an excellent model, but it is unlikely to be an exact replica of the real world. All models, if they are to be effective, require us to make certain prior assumptions about the real world. Mathematical models require the input of numbers that quantify these assumptions. If we feed incorrect data into a model, we can expect an incorrect representation of the real world. As every model user knows, “Garbage in, garbage out.” These general observations about models are no less true for option pricing models. An option model is only someone’s idea of how an option might be evaluated under certain conditions. Because either the model itself or the data that we feed into the model might be incorrect, there is no guarantee that model-generated values will be accurate. Nor can we be sure that these values will bear any logical resemblance to actual prices in the marketplace. A new option trader is like someone entering a dark room for the first time. Without any guidance, he may grope around, hoping that he eventually finds what he is looking for. The trader who is armed with a basic understanding of theoretical pricing models enters the same room with a candle. He can make out the general layout of the room, but the dimness of the candle prevents him from distinguishing every detail. Moreover, some of what he sees may be distorted by the flickering of the candle. In spite of these limitations, a trader is more likely to find what he is looking for with a small candle than with no illumination at all.2 The real problems with theoretical pricing models arise after the trader has acquired some sophistication. As he gains confidence, he may begin to increase the size of his trades. When this happens, his inability to make out every detail in the room, as well as the distortions caused by the flickering candle flame, take on increased importance. Now a misinterpretation of what he thinks he sees can lead to financial disaster because any error in judgment will be greatly magnified. The sensible approach is to make use of a model, but with a full awareness of what it can and cannot do. Option traders will find that a theoretical pricing model is an invaluable tool to understanding the pricing of options. Because of the insights gained from a model, the great majority of successful option traders rely on some type of theoretical pricing model. However, an option trader, if he is to make the best use of a theoretical pricing model, must be aware of its One might also argue that a trader with a candle (i.e., theoretical pricing model) might drop the candle and burn down the entire building. Financial crises seem to occur when many traders drop their candles at the same time. 2  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0climitations as well as its strengths. Otherwise, he may be no better off than the trader groping in the dark.3  A Simple Approach How might we adapt the concepts of expected value and theoretical value to the pricing of options? Consider an underlying contract that at expiration can take on one of five different prices: $80, $90, $100, $110, or $120. Assume, moreover, that each of the five prices is equally likely with 20 percent probability. The prices and probabilities are shown Figure 5-1. What will be the expected value for this contract at expiration? Twenty percent of the time, the contract will be worth $80; 20 percent of the time, the contract will be worth $90; and so on, up to the 20 percent of the time, the contract is worth $120: (20% × $80) + (20% × $90) + (20% × 100) + (20% × $110) + (20% × $120) = $100 At expiration, the expected value for the contract is $100. Now consider the expected value of a 100 call using the same underlying prices and probabilities. We can more easily see the value of the call by overlaying the parity graph for the call on our probability distribution. This has been done in Figure 5-2. If the underlying contract is at $80, $90, or $100, the call is worthless. If, however, the underlying contract is at $110 or $120, the option will be worth its intrinsic value of $10 and $20, respectively: (20% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (20% × $10) + (20% × $20) = $6 If we want to develop a theoretical pricing model using this approach, we might propose a series of possible prices and probabilities for the underlying contract at expiration. Then, given an exercise price, we can calculate the intrinsic value of the option at each underlying price, multiply this value by its associated probability, add up all these numbers, and thereby obtain an expected value for the option. The expected value for a call at expiration is n  ∑ p max (S i =1  i  i  − X ,0)  where each Si is a possible underlying price at expiration, and pi is the probability associated with that price. The expected value for a put is n  ∑ p max ( X − S ,0) i =1  i  i  Some interesting discussion on the limitations of models: Fischer Black, “The Holes in Black Scholes,” Risk 1(4):30–33, 1988; Stephen Figlewski, “What Does an Option Pricing Model Tell Us about Option Prices?” Financial Analysts Journal, September–October 1989, pp. 12–15; Fischer Black, “Living Up to the Model,” Risk 3(3):11–13, 1990; and Emanuel Derman and Paul Wilmott, “The Financial Modelers’ Manifesto” ( January 2009), http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2009/1/8/Financial-Modelers-Manifesto. 3  Theoretical Pricing Models  57  \\x0cFigure 5-1  Underlying price:  20%  20%  20%  20%  20%  80  90  100  110  120  Figure 5-2  +1 +1 20%  20%  20%  20%  20%  Underlying price:  80  90  100  110  120  Value of 100 call:  0  0  0  10  20  In the foregoing example, we used a simple scenario with only five possible price outcomes, each with identical probability. Obviously, this is not very realistic. What changes might we make to develop a model that more accurately reflects the real world? For one thing, we need to know the settlement procedure for the option. If the option is subject to stock-type settlement, we must pay the full price of the option. If the 100 call has an expected value of $6 at expiration, the theoretical value will be the present value of this amount. If interest rates are 12 percent annually (1 percent per month) and the option will expire in two months, the theoretical value of the option is $6.00 $6.00 = ≈ $5.88 1 + (0.12 × 2 /12) 1.02 What other factors might we consider? We assumed that all five price outcomes were equally likely. Is this a realistic assumption? Suppose that you were told that only two prices were possible at expiration, $110 and $250. If the current price of the underlying contract is close to $100, which do you think is more likely? Experience suggests that extreme price changes that are far away from today’s price are less likely than small changes that remain close to today’s price. For this reason, $110 is more likely than $250. Perhaps our probability distribution ought to reflect this by concentrating the probabilities around the current price of 10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cFigure 5-3  40%  +1 +1  20%  20% 10%  10%  Underlying price:  80  90  100  110  120  Value of 100 call:  0  0  0  10  20  the underlying contract. One possible distribution is shown in Figure 5-3. Using these new probabilities, the expected value for the 100 call is now (0% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (0% × 0) + (20% × $10) + (10% × $20) = $4 If, as before, the option is subject to stock-type settlement, the theoretical value is $4.00 ≈ $3.92 1.02 Note that the new probabilities did not change the expected value for the underlying contract. Because the probabilities are symmetrical around $100, the expected value for the underlying contract at expiration is still $100. No matter how we assign probabilities, we will want to do so in such a way that the expected value for the underlying contract represents the most likely, or average, value at expiration. What is the most likely future value for the underlying contract? In fact, there is no way to know. But we might ask what the marketplace thinks the most likely value is. Recall what would happen if the theoretical forward price were different from the actual price of a forward contract in the marketplace. Everyone would execute an arbitrage by either buying or selling the forward contract and taking the opposite position in the cash market. In a sense, the marketplace must think that the forward price is the most likely future value for the underlying contract. If we assume that the underlying market is arbitrage-free, the expected value for the underlying contract must be equal to the forward price. Suppose in our example that the underlying contract is a stock that is currently trading at $100 and that pays no dividend prior to expiration. The twomonth forward price for the stock is $100 × [1 + (0.12 × 2/12) ] = $100 × 1.02 = $102 If $102 is the expected value for the stock, instead of assigning the probabilities symmetrically around $100, we may want to assign them symmetrically 10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0caround $102. This distribution is shown in Figure 5-4. Now the expected value for the 100 call is (10% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (40% × $2) + (20% × $12) + (10% × $22) = $5.40 and the theoretical value is $5.40 ≈ $5.29 1.02 In the examples thus far, we have assumed a symmetrical probability distribution. But as long as the expected value is equal to the forward price, there is no requirement that the probabilities be assigned symmetrically. Figure 5-5 shows a distribution where the price outcomes are neither centered around the forward price nor are the probabilities symmetrical. Nonetheless, the expected value for the underlying contract is still equal to $102 (6% × 83) + (15% × 90) + (39% × $99) + (33% × $110) + (7% × $123) = 4.98 + 13.5 + 38.61 + 36.30 + 8.61 = $102 Using these probabilities, the theoretical value of the 100 call is (33% × $10) + (7% × $23) 3.30 + 1.61 4.91 = = ≈ $4.81 1.02 1.02 1.02 The forward price of the underlying contract plays a central role in all option pricing models. For European options, the current price of the underlying contract is important only insofar as it can be turned into a forward price. Because of this, traders sometimes make the distinction between options that are at the money (the exercise price is equal to the current underlying price) and options which are at the forward (the exercise price is equal to the forward price at expiration). In many markets, at-the-forward options are the most actively traded, and such options are often used by traders as a benchmark for evaluating and trading other options. Even if we assume an arbitrage-free market in the underlying contract, we still have a major hurdle to overcome. In our simplified model, we assumed that Figure 5-4  40%  +1 +1  20%  20% 10%  10%  Underlying price:  82  92  102  112  122  Value of 100 call:  0  0  2  12  22  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cFigure 5-5  39%  +1  33% +1  15% 7%  6%  Underlying price:  83  90  99  110  123  Value of 100 call:  0  0  0  10  23  there were only five possible price outcomes. In the real world, however, there are an infinite number of possibilities. To enable our model to more closely approximate the real world, we would like to construct a probability distribution with every possible price outcome together with its associated probability. This may seem an insurmountable obstacle, but we will see in subsequent chapters how we might approximate such a probability distribution. We can now summarize the necessary steps in developing a model: 1. Propose a series of possible prices at expiration for the underlying contract. 2. Assign a probability to each possible price with the restriction that the underlying market is arbitrage-free—the expected value for the underlying contract must be equal to the forward price. 3. From the prices and probabilities in steps 1 and 2, and from the chosen exercise price, calculate the expected value of the option. 4. Lastly, depending on the option’s settlement procedure, calculate the present value of the expected value.  The Black-Scholes Model One of the first attempts to describe traded options in detail was a pamphlet written by Charles Castelli and published in London in 1877, “The Theory of Options in Stocks and Shares.”4 This pamphlet included a description of some commonly used hedging and trading strategies such as the “call-of-more” and the “call-and-put.” Today, these strategies are known as a covered-write and a straddle. The origins of modern option pricing theory are most often ascribed to the year 1900, when French mathematician Louis Bachelier published The Theory 4  A photocopy of the Castelli pamphlet, which is now in the public domain, is available at books.google.com. 10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cof Speculation, the first attempt to use higher mathematics to price option contracts.5 Although Bachelier’s treatise was an interesting academic study, it resulted in little practical application because there were no organized option markets at that time. However, in 1973, concurrent with the opening of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Fischer Black, at the time associated with the University of Chicago, and Myron Scholes, associated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, built on the work of Bachelier and other academics to introduce the first practical theoretical pricing model for options.6 The Black-Scholes model,7 with its relatively simple arithmetic and limited number of inputs, most of which were easily observable, proved an ideal tool for traders in the newly opened U.S. option market. Although other models have subsequently been introduced to overcome some of its original weaknesses, the Black-Scholes model remains the most widely used of all option pricing models. In its original form, the Black-Scholes model was intended to evaluate European options (no early exercise permitted) on non-dividend-paying stocks. Shortly after its introduction, realizing that many stocks pay dividends, Black and Scholes added a dividend component. In 1976, Fischer Black made slight modifications to the model to allow for the evaluation of options on futures contracts.8 In 1983, Mark Garman and Steven Kohlhagen of the University of California at Berkeley made additional modifications to allow for the evaluation of options on foreign currencies.9 The futures version and the foreign-currency version are known formally as the Black model and the Garman-Kohlhagen model, respectively. However, the evaluation method in each variation, whether the original Black-Scholes model for stock options, the Black model for futures options, or the Garman-Kohlhagen model for foreign currency options, is so similar that they have all come to be known simply as the Black-Scholes model. The various forms of the model differ only in how they calculate the forward price of the underlying contract and the settlement procedure for the options. An option trader will simply choose the form appropriate to the options and underlying instrument in which he is interested. Given its widespread use and its importance in the development of other pricing models, we will, for the moment, restrict ourselves to a discussion of the Black-Scholes model and its various forms. In later chapters we will consider the question of early exercise. We will also look at alternative methods for pricing options when we question some of the basic assumptions in the BlackScholes model. See Louis Bachelier’s Theory of Speculation, Mark Davis and Alison Etheridge, trans. (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006). A translation of Bachelier’s treatise also appears in The Random Character of Stock Market Prices, Paul Cootner, ed. (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1964). 6 Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, “The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities,” Journal of Political Economy 81(3):637–654, 1973. 7 Robert Merton, who, at the time, was, like Myron Scholes, associated with MIT, is also credited with some of the same work that led to the development of the original Black-Scholes model. His paper, “The Rational Theory of Option Pricing,” appeared in the Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science 4(Spring):141–183, 1973. In recognition of Merton’s contribution, the model is sometimes referred to as the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Scholes and Merton were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997; Fischer Black, unfortunately, died in 1995. 8 Fischer Black, “The Pricing of Commodity Contracts,” Journal of Financial Economics 3:167–179, 1976. 9 Mark B. Garman and Steven W. Kohlhagen, “Foreign Currency Option Values,” Journal of International Money and Finance 2(3):239–253, 1983. We are speaking here of options on a physical foreign currency rather than options on a foreign-currency futures contract. The latter may be evaluated using the Black model for futures options. 5  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cThe reasoning that led to the development of the Black-Scholes model is similar to the simple approach we took earlier in this chapter for evaluating options. Black and Scholes worked originally with call values, but put values can be derived in much the same way. Alternatively, we will see later that for European options there is a unique pricing relationship between an underlying contract and a call and put with the same exercise price and expiration date. This relationship will enable us to derive a put value from the companion call value or a call value from the companion put value. To calculate an option’s theoretical value using the Black-Scholes model, we need to know, at a minimum, five characteristics of the option and its underlying contract: 1. The option’s exercise price 2. The time remaining to expiration 3. The current price of the underlying contract 4. The applicable interest rate over the life of the option 5. The volatility of the underlying contract The last input, volatility, may be unfamiliar to a new trader. While we will put off a detailed discussion of this input to Chapter 6, from our previous discussion, we can reasonably infer that volatility is related to either the speed of the underlying market or the probabilities of different price outcomes. If we know each of the required inputs, we can feed them into the theoretical pricing model and thereby generate a theoretical value (see Figure 5-6). Black and Scholes also incorporated into their model the concept of a riskless hedge. For every option position, there is a theoretically equivalent position in the underlying contract such that, for small price changes in the underlying contract, the option position will gain or lose value at exactly the same rate as the underlying position. To take advantage of a theoretically mispriced option, Figure 5-6  Exercise price Time to expiration Underlying price  Pricing model  Theoretical value  Interest rate Volatility  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cit is necessary to establish this riskless hedge by offsetting the option position with a theoretically equivalent underlying position. That is, whatever option position we take, we must take an opposing market position in the underlying contract. The correct proportion of underlying contracts needed to establish this riskless hedge is determined by the option’s hedge ratio. Why is it necessary to establish a riskless hedge? Recall that in our simplified approach, an option’s theoretical value depended on the probability of various price outcomes for the underlying contract. As the price of the underlying contract changes, the probability of each outcome will also change. If the underlying price is currently $100 and we assign a 25 percent probability to $120, we might drop the probability for $120 to 10 percent if the price of the underlying contract falls to $90. By initially establishing a riskless hedge and then adjusting the hedge as market conditions change, we are taking into consideration these changing probabilities. In this sense, an option can be thought of as a substitute for a position in the underlying contract. A call is a substitute for a long position; a put is a substitute for a short position. Whether the substitute position is better than an outright position in the underlying contract depends on the theoretical value of the option compared with its price in the marketplace. If a call can be purchased for less than its theoretical value or a put can be sold for more than its value, in the long run, it will be more profitable to take a long market position by purchasing calls or selling puts than by purchasing the underlying contract. In the same way, if a put can be purchased for less than its theoretical value or a call can be sold for more than its value, in the long run, it will be more profitable to take a short market position by purchasing puts or selling calls than by selling the underlying contract. In later chapters we will discuss the concept of a riskless hedge in greater detail. For now, we simply summarize the four basic option positions, their corresponding market positions, and the appropriate hedges: Option Position  Corresponding Market Position  Appropriate Hedge  Buy call(s)  Long  Sell underlying  Sell call(s)  Short  Buy underlying  Buy put(s)  Short  Buy underlying  Sell put(s)  Long  Sell underlying  For new traders, it may be helpful to point out that we are always doing the opposite with calls and the underlying (i.e., buy calls, sell the underlying; sell calls, buy the underlying) and doing the same with puts and the underlying (i.e., buy puts, buy the underlying; sell puts, sell the underlying). Especially with puts, more than a few new traders have initially done it backwards, buying puts and selling the underlying or selling puts and buying the underlying. This, of course, is no hedge at all. Because the theoretical value obtained from a theoretical pricing model is no better than the inputs into the model, a few comments on each of the inputs will be worthwhile. 10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cExercise Price There should never be any doubt about the exercise price of an option because it is fixed under the terms of the contract and does not vary over the life of the option.10 A March 60 call cannot suddenly turn into a March 55 call. A September 100 put cannot turn into a September 110 put.  Time to Expiration As with the exercise price, an option’s expiration date is fixed and will not vary. A March 60 call will not suddenly turn into an April 60 call, nor will a September 100 put turn into an August 100 put. Of course, each day that passes brings us closer to expiration, so in this sense the time to expiration is constantly growing shorter. However, the expiration date, like the exercise price, is fixed by the exchange and will not change. In financial models, one year is typically the standard unit of time. Therefore, time to expiration is entered into the Black-Scholes model as an annualized number. If we express time in terms of days, we must make the appropriate adjustment by dividing the number of days to expiration by 365. However, most option-evaluation computer programs already have this transformation incorporated into the software, so we need only enter the correct number of days remaining to expiration. It may seem that we have a problem in deciding what number of days to enter into the model. We need the amount of time remaining to expiration for two purposes: (1) to determine the likelihood of price movement in the underlying contract and (2) to make interest calculations. For the former, we are only interested in days on which the price of the underlying contract can change. For exchange-traded contracts, this can only occur on business days. This might lead us to drop weekends and holidays from our calculations. On the other hand, for interest-rate purposes, we must include every day. If we borrow or lend money, we expect interest to accrue every day, no matter that some of those days are not business days. However, this is not really a problem. In determining the likelihood of price movement in the underlying contract, we observe only business days because these are the only days on which price changes can occur. Then we scale these values to an annualized number before feeding it into the theoretical pricing model. The result is that we can feed into our model the actual number of days remaining to expiration, knowing that the model will interpret all inputs correctly. Although traders typically express time to expiration in days, a trader may want to use a different measure. Especially as expiration approaches, a trader may prefer to use hours or even minutes. In theory, finer time increments should yield more accurate values. But there is a practical limitation to using very small increments of time. As time passes, the discrete increments of time we feed into a theoretical pricing model may not accurately represent the continuous passage An exchange may adjust the exercise price of a stock option as the result of a stock split or in the case of an extraordinary dividend. In practical terms, this is only an accounting change. The characteristics of the option contract remain essentially unchanged. 10  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cof time in the real world. Most traders have learned through experience that as expiration approaches, the use of a theoretical pricing model becomes less reliable because the inputs become less reliable. Indeed, very close to expiration, many traders stop using model-generated values altogether.  Underlying Price Unlike the exercise price and time to expiration, the correct price of the underlying contract is not always obvious. At any one time, there is a bid price and an ask price (the bid-ask spread), and it may not be clear whether we ought to use one or the other of these prices or perhaps some price in between. Consider an underlying market where the last trade price was 75.25 but that is currently displaying the following bid-ask spread: 75.20–75.40 If a trader is using a theoretical pricing model to evaluate options on this market, what price should he feed into the model? One possibility is 72.25, the last trade price. Another possibility might be 75.30, the midpoint of the bid-ask spread. Even though we are focusing on the use of theoretical pricing models, we should emphasize that there is no law that says a trader must make any decisions based on or consistent with a theoretical pricing model. A trader can simply buy or sell options and hope that the trade turns out favorably. But a disciplined trader who uses a pricing model knows that he is required to hedge the option position by taking an opposing market position in the underlying contract. Therefore, the underlying price that he feeds into the theoretical pricing model ought to be the price at which he believes he can make the opposing trade. If the trader intends to purchase calls or sell puts, both of which are long market positions, he will hedge by selling the underlying contract. In this case, he will want to use something close to the bid price because that is the price at which he can probably sell the underlying. On the other hand, if the trader intends to sell calls or buy puts, both of which are short market positions, he will hedge by purchasing the underlying contract. Now he will want to use something close to the ask price because that is the price at which he can probably buy the underlying. In practice, if the underlying market is very liquid, with a narrow bid-ask spread and many contracts available at each price, a trader who must make a quick decision may very well use a price close to the midpoint because that probably represents a reasonable estimate of where the underlying can be bought or sold. But in an illiquid market, with a very wide bid-ask spread and only a few contracts available at each price, the trader must give extra thought to the appropriate underlying price. In such a market, particularly if the prices are changing rapidly, it may be difficult to execute even a small order at the quoted prices.  Interest Rates Because an option trade may result in either a cash credit or debit to a trader’s account, the interest considerations resulting from this cash flow must also play a role in option evaluation. This is a function of interest rates over the life of the option. 10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cInterest rates play two roles in the theoretical evaluation of options. First, they may affect the forward price of the underlying contract. If the underlying contract is subject to stock-type settlement, as we raise interest rates, we raise the forward price, increasing the value of calls and decreasing the value of puts. Second, interest rates may affect the present value of the option. If the option is subject to stock-type settlement, as we raise interest rates, we reduce the present value of the option. Although interest rates may affect both the forward price and the present value, in most cases, the same rate is applicable, and we need only input one interest rate into the model. If, however, different rates are applicable, as would be the case with foreign-currency options (the foreign-currency interest rate plays one role, and the domestic-currency interest rate plays a different role), the model will require the input of two interest rates. This is the case with the Garman-Kohlhagen version of the Black-Scholes model. What interest rate should a trader use when evaluating options? Textbooks often suggest using the risk-free rate, the rate that applies to the most creditworthy borrower. In most markets, the government is considered the most secure borrower of funds, so the yield on a government security with a maturity equivalent to the life of the option is the general benchmark. For a 60-day option denominated in dollars, we might use the yield on a 60-day U.S. Treasury bill; for a 180-day option, we might use the yield on a 180-day U.S. Treasury bill. In practice, no individual can borrow or lend at the same rate as the government, so it seems unrealistic to use the risk-free rate. To determine a more realistic rate, a trader might look to a freely traded market in interest-rate contracts. In this respect, traders often use either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)11 or the Eurocurrency markets to determine the applicable rate. For dollar-denominated options, Eurodollar futures traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are often used to determine a benchmark interest rate. The situation is further complicated by the fact that most traders do not borrow and lend at the same rate, so the correct interest rate will, in theory, depend on whether the trade will create a credit or a debit. In the former case, the trader will be interested in the borrowing rate; in the latter case, he will be interested in the lending rate. However, among the inputs into the model—the underlying price, time to expiration, interest rates, and volatility—interest rates tend to play the least important role. Using a rate that “makes sense” is usually a reasonable solution. Of course, for very large positions or for very long-term options, small changes in the interest rate can have a large impact. But for most traders, getting the interest rate exactly right is usually not a major consideration.  Dividends We did not list dividends as a model input in Figure 5-5 because they are only a factor in the theoretical evaluation of stock options and then only if the stock is expected to pay a dividend over the life of the option. In order to evaluate a stock option, the model must accurately calculate the forward price for the stock. The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the rate paid by the London banks on dollar deposits. As such, it reflects the free-market interest rate for dollars. LIBOR is the underlying for Eurodollar futures traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The value of these contracts at maturity is determined by the average three-month LIBOR rate quoted by the largest London banks. 11  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0cThis requires us to estimate both the amount of the dividend and the date on which the dividend will be paid. In practice, rather than using the date of dividend payment, an option trader is likely to focus on the ex-dividend date, the date on which the stock is trading without the rights to the dividend. The exact dividend payment date is important in calculating the interest that can be earned on the dividend payment and thereby calculating a more accurate forward price. But for a trader ownership of the stock in order to receive the dividend is the primary consideration. A deeply in-the-money option may have many of the same characteristics as stock, but only ownership of the stock carries with it the rights to the dividend. In the absence of other information, most traders assume that a company is likely to continue its past dividend policy. If a company has been paying a 75-cent dividend each quarter, it will probably continue to do so. However, until the company officially declares the dividend, this is not a certainty. A company may increase or reduce its dividend or omit it completely. If there is the possibility of a change in a company’s dividend policy, a trader must consider its impact on option values. Additionally, if the ex-dividend date is expected just prior to expiration, a delay of several days will cause the ex-dividend date to fall after expiration. For purposes of option evaluation, this is the same as eliminating the dividend entirely. In such a situation, a trader will need to make a special effort to ascertain the exact ex-dividend date.  Volatility Of all the inputs required for option evaluation, volatility is the most difficult for traders to understand. At the same time, volatility often plays the most important role in actual trading decisions. Changes in our assumptions about volatility can have a dramatic effect on an option’s value. And the manner in which the marketplace assesses volatility can have an equally dramatic effect on an option’s price. For these reasons, we will begin a detailed discussion of volatility in Chapter 6.  10/10/14 2:28 PM  \\x0c6 Volatility What is volatility, and why is it so important in option evaluation? The option trader, like a trader in the underlying instrument, is interested in the direction of the market. But unlike a trader in the underlying, an option trader is also sensitive to the speed of the market. If the market for an underlying contract fails to move at a sufficient speed, options on that contract will have less value because of the reduced likelihood of the market going through an option’s exercise price. In a sense, volatility is a measure of the speed of the market. Markets that move slowly are low-volatility markets; markets that move quickly are high-volatility markets. One might guess intuitively that some markets are more volatile than others. During 2008, the price of crude oil began the year at $99 per barrel, reached a high of $144 per barrel in July, and finished the year at $45 per barrel. The price rose 58 percent and then dropped 69 percent. Yet few traders could imagine a major stock index such as the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index exhibiting similar fluctuations over a single year. If we know whether a market will be relatively volatile or relatively quiet and can convey this information to a theoretical pricing model, any evaluation of options on that market will be more accurate than if we simply ignore volatility. Because option models are based on mathematical formulas, we will need some method of quantifying this volatility component so that we can feed it into the model in numerical form.  Random Walks and Normal Distributions Consider for a moment the pinball maze pictured in Figure 6-1. When a ball is dropped into the maze at the top, it falls downward, pulled by gravity through a series of nails. When the ball encounters each nail, there is a 50 percent chance that the ball will move to the left and a 50 percent chance that it will move to the right. The ball then falls down a level where it encounters another nail. Finally, at the bottom of the maze, the ball falls into one of the troughs.

As the ball falls down through the maze, it follows a random walk. Once the ball enters the maze, nothing can be done to artificially alter its course, nor can one predict the path that the ball will follow through the maze. As more balls are dropped into the maze, they might begin to form a distribution similar to that in Figure 6-2. Most of the balls tend to cluster near the center of the maze, with a decreasing number of balls ending up in troughs farther away from the center. If many balls are dropped into the maze, they will begin to form a bell-shaped or normal distribution. If an infinite number of balls were dropped into the maze, the resulting distribution might be approximated by a normal distribution curve such as the one overlaid on the distribution in Figure 6-2. Such a curve is symmetrical (if we flip it from right to left, it looks the same), it has its peak in the center, and its tails always move down and away from the center. Normal distribution curves are used to describe the likely outcomes of random events. For example, the curve in Figure 6-2 might also represent the results of flipping a coin 15 times. Each outcome, or trough, represents the number of heads that occur from each 15 flips. An outcome in trough 0 represents 0 heads and 15 tails; an outcome in trough 15 represents 15 heads and 0 tails. Of course, we would be surprised to flip a coin 15 times and get all heads or all tails. Assuming that the coin is perfectly balanced, some outcome in between, perhaps 8 heads and 7 tails, or 9 heads and 6 tails, seems more likely. Suppose that we rearrange the nails in our maze so that each time a ball encounters a nail and moves either left or right, it must drop down two levels before it encounters another nail. If we drop enough balls into the maze, we may end up with a distribution similar to the curve in Figure 6-3. Because the 70  Figure 6-2 Normal distribution. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

In spite of its altered shape, the distribution is still normal, although one with slightly different characteristics. Finally, we might again rearrange the nails so that each time a ball drops down a level, it must move two nails left or right before it can drop down to a new level. If we drop enough balls into the maze, we may get a distribution that resembles the curve in Figure 6-4. This distribution, although still normal, will have a much lower peak and spread out much more quickly than the distributions in either Figure 6-2 or Figure 6-3.1 Suppose that we now think of the ball’s sideways movement as the up and down price movement of an underlying contract and the ball’s downward movement as the passage of time. If the price movement of an underlying contract follows a random walk, the curves in Figures 6-2 through 6-4 might represent possible price distributions in a moderate-, low-, and high-volatility market, respectively. Earlier in this chapter we suggested that the theoretical pricing of options begins by assigning probabilities to the various underlying prices. How should these probabilities be assigned? One possibility is to assume that, at expiration, the underlying prices are normally distributed. Given that there are many different normal distributions, how will our choice of distribution affect option evaluation? Because all normal distributions are symmetrical, it may seem that the choice of distribution is irrelevant. Increased volatility may increase the likelihood of large upward movement, but this should be offset by the greater likelihood of large downward movement. However, there is an important distinction between Figure 6-4  The pinball maze, or quincunx (sometimes also called a Galton board), pictured in these examples is often used to demonstrate basic probability theory. Examples of a quincunx in action can be found at the following websites: http://www.teacherlink.org/content/math/interactive/flash/quincunx/quincunx.html http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/quincunx.html http://www.jcu.edu/math/isep/Quincunx/Quincunx.html 1  72  O P T I O N V O L AT I L I T Y A N D P R I C I N G  \\x0cFigure 6-5  Low-volatility distribution  Current underlying price  Moderate-volatility distribution Exercise price  High-volatility distribution  Call value  Price distribution at expiration  an option position and an underlying position. The expected value for an underlying contract depends on all possible price outcomes. The expected value for an option depends only on the outcomes that result in the option finishing in the money. Everything else is zero. In Figure 6-5, we have three possible price distributions centered around the current price of an underlying contract. Suppose that we want to evaluate a call at a higher exercise price. The value of the call will depend on the amount of the distribution to the right of the exercise price. We can see that as we move from a low-volatility distribution, to a moderate-volatility distribution, to a high-volatility distribution, a greater portion of the possible price distribution lies to the right of the exercise price. Consequently, the option takes on an increasingly greater value. We might also consider the value of a put at a lower exercise price. If we assume that movement is random, the same high-volatility distribution that will cause the call to take on greater value will also cause the put to take on greater value. In the case of the put, more of the distribution will lie to the left of the exercise price. Because our distributions are symmetrical, in a high-volatility market, all options, whether calls or puts, higher or lower exercise prices, take on greater value. For the same reason, in a low-volatility market, all options take on reduced values.  Mean and Standard Deviation If we assume a normal distribution of prices, we will need a method of describing the appropriate normal distribution to the theoretical pricing model. Fortunately, all normal distributions can be fully described with two 10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cnumbers—the mean and the standard deviation. If we know that a distribution is normal, and we also know the mean and standard deviation, then we know all the characteristics of the distribution. Graphically, we can interpret the mean as the location of the peak of the distribution and the standard deviation as a measure of how fast the distribution spreads out. Distributions that spread out very quickly, such as the one in Figure 6-4, have a high standard deviation. Distributions that spread out very slowly, such as the one in Figure 6-3, have a low standard deviation. Numerically, the mean is simply the average outcome, a concept familiar to most traders. To calculate the mean, we add up all the results and divide by the total number of occurrences. Calculation of the standard deviation is not quite so simple and will be discussed later. What is important at this point is the interpretation of these numbers, in particular, what a mean and standard deviation suggest in terms of likely price movement. Let’s go back to Figure 6-2 and consider the troughs numbered 0 to 15 at the bottom. We suggested that these numbers might represent the number of heads resulting from 15 flips of a coin. Alternatively, they might represent the number of times a ball goes to the right at each nail as it drops down through the maze. The first trough is assigned 0 because any ball that ends there must go left at every nail. The last trough is assigned 15 because any ball that ends there must go right at every nail. Suppose that we are told that the mean and standard deviation in Figure 6-2 are 7.50 and 3.00, respectively.2 What does this tell us about the distribution? The mean tells us the average outcome. If we add up all the outcomes and divide by the number of occurrences, the result will be 7.50. In terms of the troughs, the average result will fall halfway between troughs 7 and 8. (Of course, this is not an actual possibility. However, we noted in Chapter 5 that the average outcome does not have to be an actual possibility for any one outcome.) The standard deviation determines not only how fast the distribution spreads out, but it also tells us something about the likelihood of a ball ending up in a specific trough or group of troughs. In particular, the standard deviation tells us the probability of a ball ending up in a trough that is a specified distance from the mean. For example, we may want to know the likelihood of a ball falling down through the maze and ending up in a trough lower than 5 or higher than 10. The answer to this question depends on the number of standard deviations the ball must move away from the mean. If we know this, we can determine the probability associated with that number of standard deviations. The exact probability associated with any specific number of standard deviations can be found in most texts on statistics or probability. Alternatively, such probabilities can be easily calculated in most commonly used computer spreadsheet programs. For option traders, the following approximations will be useful: ±1 standard deviation takes in approximately 68.3 percent (about 2/3) of all occurrences. The reader who is familiar with the mean and standard deviation and who would like to check the arithmetic will find that the actual mean and standard deviation are 7.49 and 3.02. For simplicity, we have rounded these to 7.50 and 3.00. 2  74  ±2 standard deviations takes in approximately 95.4 percent (about 19/20) of all occurrences. ±3 standard deviations takes in approximately 99.7 percent (about 369/370) of all occurrences. Note that each number of standard deviations is preceded by a plus or minus sign. Because normal distributions are symmetrical, the likelihood of up movement and down movement is identical. The probability associated with each number of standard deviations is usually given as a decimal value, but a fractional approximation is often useful to traders, and this appears in parentheses. Now let’s try to answer our question about the likelihood of getting a ball in a trough lower than 5 or higher than 10. We can designate the divider between troughs 7 and 8 as the mean, 7½. If the standard deviation is 3, what troughs are within one standard deviation of the mean? One standard deviation from the mean is 7½ ± 3, or 4½ to10½. Interpreting ½ as the divider between troughs, we can see that troughs 5 through 10 fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean. We know that one standard deviation takes in about two-thirds of all occurrences, so we can conclude that out of every three balls we drop into the maze, two should end up in troughs 5 through 10. Whatever is left over, one out of every three balls, will end up in one of the remaining troughs, 0 through 4 and 11 through 15. Hence, the answer to our original question about the likelihood of getting a ball in a trough lower than 5 or higher than 10 is about 1 chance in 3, or about 33 percent. (The exact answer is 100% – 68.3% = 31.7%.) This is shown in Figure 6-6. Let’s try another calculation, but this time we can think of the problem as a wager. Suppose that someone offers us 30 to 1 odds against dropping a ball into the maze and having it end up specifically in troughs 14 or 15. Is this bet worth making? One characteristic of standard deviations is that they are additive. In our example, if one standard deviation is 3, then two standard deviations are 6. Two standard deviations from the mean is therefore 7½ ± 6, or 1½ to 13½. We can see in Figure 6-6 that troughs 14 and 15 lie outside two standard deviations. Because the probability of getting a result within two standard deviations is approximately 19 out of 20, the probability of getting a result beyond two standard deviations is 1 chance in 20. Therefore, 30 to 1 odds may seem very favorable. Recall, however, that beyond two standard deviations also includes troughs 0 and 1. Because normal distributions are symmetrical, the chances of getting a ball specifically in troughs 14 or 15 must be half of 1 chance in 20, or about 1 chance in 40. At 30 to 1 odds, the bet must be a bad one because the odds do not sufficiently compensate us for the risk involved. In Chapter 5, we suggested that a truly accurate theoretical pricing model would require us to assign probabilities to an infinite number of possible price outcomes for an underlying contract. Then, if we multiply each price outcome by its associated probability, we can use the results to calculate an option’s theoretical value. The problem is that an infinite number of anything is not easy to work with. Fortunately, the characteristics of normal distributions are so well known that formulas have been developed that facilitate the computation of both the probabilities associated with every point along a normal distribution 10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cFigure 6-6  mean = 7.50 standard deviation = 3.00  ± 1 st. dev. = 68.3% (approx. 2/3) ± 2 st. dev. = 95.4% (approx. 19/20) ± 3 st. dev. = 99.7% (approx. 369/370) 95%  68%  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 –2 st. dev. 1.50  –1 st. dev. 4.50  mean 7.50  +1 st. dev. 10.50  +2 st. dev. 13.50  curve and the area under various portions of the curve. If we assume that prices of an underlying instrument are normally distributed, these formulas represent a unique set of tools to help us solve for an option’s theoretical value. Louis Bachelier was the first to make the assumption that the prices of an underlying contract are normally distributed. As we shall see, there are logical problems with this assumption. Consequently, over the years, the assumption has been modified to make it more consistent with real-world conditions. In its modified form, it is the basis for many theoretical pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model.  Forward Price as the Mean of a Distribution If we decide to assign probabilities that are consistent with a normal distribution, how do we feed this distribution into a theoretical pricing model? Because all normal distributions can be described by a mean and a standard deviation, in some way we must feed these two numbers into our pricing model. In Chapter 5, we suggested that any distribution ought to be centered around the most likely underlying price at expiration. Although we cannot 76  know exactly what that price will be, if we assume that no arbitrage opportunity exists in the underlying contract, a logical guess is the forward price. If we make the assumption that the forward price represents the mean of a distribution, then in the long run, any trade made at the current underlying price will just break even. The various forms of the Black-Scholes model differ primarily in how they calculate the forward price. Depending on the type of underlying contract, whether a stock, a futures contract, or a foreign currency, the model takes the current underlying price, the time to expiration, interest rates, and, in the case of stocks, dividends to calculate the forward price. It then makes this the mean of the distribution.  Volatility as a Standard Deviation In addition to the mean, to fully describe a normal distribution, we also need a standard deviation. When we input a volatility into a theoretical pricing model, we are actually feeding in a standard deviation. Volatility is just a trader’s term for standard deviation. Because the Greek letter sigma (σ) is the traditional notation for standard deviation, in this text we will use the same notation for volatility. At this point, it will help if we assign a working definition to volatility, although we will later modify this definition slightly. For the present, we will assume that the volatility we feed into a pricing model represents a one standard deviation price change, in percent, over a one-year period. For example, consider a contract with a one-year forward price of 100 and that we are told has a volatility of 20 percent. (We’ll discuss later where this number might come from.) With a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20 percent, if we come back one year from now, there is a 68 percent probability that the contract will be trading between 80 and 120 (100 ± 20%), a 95 percent probability that the contract will be trading between 60 and 140 (100 ± 2 × 20%), and a 99.7 percent probability that the contract will be trading between 40 and 160 (100 ± 3 × 20%). These are the probabilities associated with one, two, and three standard deviations. Instead of specifying the forward price, suppose that we are dealing with a stock that is currently trading at $100 and that has the same 20 percent volatility. In order to determine the one-year probabilities, we must first determine the one-year forward price because this represents the mean of the distribution. If interest rates are 8 percent and the stock pays no dividends, the one-year forward price will be $108. Now, a one standard deviation price change is 20% × $108 = $21.60. Thus, one year from now, we would expect the same stock to be trading between $86.40 and $129.60 ($108 ± $21.60) approximately 68 percent of the time, between $64.80 and $151.20 ($108 ± 2 × $21.60) approximately 95 percent of the time, and between $43.20 and $172.80 ($108 ± 3 × $21.60) approximately 99.7 percent of the time. Returning to our contract with a forward price of 100, suppose that we come back at the end of one year and find that the contract, which we thought had a volatility of 20 percent, is trading at 35. Does this mean that the volatility of 20 percent was wrong? A price change of more than three standard deviations may be unlikely, but one should not confuse unlikely with impossible. 10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cFlipping a perfectly balanced coin 15 times may result in 15 heads, even though the odds of this occurring are less than one chance in 32,000. If 20 percent is the right volatility, the probability that the price will fall from 100 to 35 in one year is less than one chance in 1,500. However, one chance in 1,500 is not impossible, and perhaps this was the one time in 1,500 when the price did indeed end up at 35. Of course, it is also possible that we had the wrong volatility. But we can’t make that determination without looking at a large number of price changes for the contract so that we have a representative price distribution.  Scaling Volatility for Time Like interest rates, volatility is always expressed as an annualized number. If someone says that interest rates are 6 percent, no one needs to ask whether that means 6 percent per day, 6 percent per week, or 6 percent per month. Everyone knows that it means 6 percent per year. The same is true of volatility. We might logically ask what an annual volatility tells us about the likelihood of price changes over some shorter period of time. Although interest rates are proportional to time (we simply multiply the rate by the amount of time), volatility is proportional to the square root of time. To calculate a volatility, or standard deviation, over some period of time other than one year, we must multiply the annual volatility be the square root of time, where the time period t is expressed in years Volatility t = volatility annual × t Traders typically calculate volatility for an underlying contract by observing price changes at regular intervals. Let’s begin by assuming that we plan to observe price changes at the end of every day. Because there are 365 days in a year, it might seem that prices can change 365 times per year. In this text, though, we are focusing primarily on exchange-traded contracts. Because most exchanges are closed on weekends and holidays, if we observe the price of an underlying contract at the end of every day, prices cannot really change 365 times per year. Depending on the exchange, there are probably somewhere between 250 and 260 trading days in a year.3 Because we need the square root of the number of trading days, for convenience, many traders assume that there are 256 trading days in a year given that the square root of 256 is a whole number, 16. If we make this assumption, then Volatility daily = volatility annual × 1/ 256 = volatility annual × 1/16 =  volatility annual 16  To approximate a daily standard deviation, we can divide the annual volatility by 16. Returning to our contract trading at 100 with a volatility of 20 percent, what is a one standard deviation price change from one day to the next? As markets around the world become more integrated, and with the advent of electronic trading, it may become more difficult to determine exactly what fraction of a year one day represents. Depending on the contract and exchange, in some cases it may be sensible to look at prices every day, 365 days per year. 3  78  The answer is 20%/16 = 1¼%, so a one standard deviation daily price change is 1¼% × 100 = 1.25. We expect to see a price change of 1.25 or less approximately two trading days out of every three and a price change of 2.50 or less approximately 19 trading days out of every 20. Only one day in 20 would we expect to see a price change of more than 2.50. We can do the same type of calculation for a weekly standard deviation. Now we must ask how many times per year prices can change if we look at prices once a week. There are no complete weeks when no trading takes place, so we must make our calculations using all 52 trading weeks in a year. Therefore, Volatility weekly = volatility annual × 1/ 52 ≈ volatility annual × 1/7.2 =  volatility annual 7.2  To approximate a weekly standard deviation, we can divide the annual volatility by 7.2. Dividing our annual volatility of 20 percent by the square root of 52, or approximately 7.2, we get 20%/7.2 » 2.78. For our contract trading at 100, we would expect to see a price change of 2.78 or less two weeks out of every three, a price change of 5.56 or less 19 weeks out of every 20, and only one week in 20 would we expect to see a price change of more than 5.56. If we want to be as accurate as possible, when estimating a daily or weekly standard deviation, we ought to begin by calculating the one-day or one-week forward price. But for short periods of time, the forward price is so close to the current price that most traders assume for convenience that a one-day or oneweek distribution is centered around the current price. Suppose that a stock is trading at $45 per share and has an annual volatility of 37 percent. What is an approximate one and two standard deviation price range from one day to the next and from one week to the next? For one day, we can divide the annual volatility by 16 (the square root of 256, the number of trading days in a year) $45 ×  37% ≈ $1.04 16  A one and two standard deviation daily price range is approximately $45 ± $1.04 ≈ $43.96 to $46.04 (one standard deviation) $45 ± (2 × $1.04) ≈ $42.92 to $47.08 (two standard deviations) For one week, we can divide the annual volatility by 7.2 (the square root of 52, the number of trading weeks in a year) 37% = $2.31 7.2 A one and two standard deviation weekly price range is approximately $45 ×  $45 ± $2.31 ≈ $42.69 to $47.31 $45 ± (2 × $2.31) ≈ $40.38 to $49.62  (one standard deviation) (two standard deviations)  When we scale volatility for time, the same probabilities still apply. Approximately 68 percent of the occurrences will fall within one standard deviation. Approximately 95 percent of the occurrences will fall within two standard deviations. 10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cVolatility and Observed Price Changes Why might a trader want to estimate daily or weekly price changes from an annual volatility? Volatility is the one input into a theoretical pricing model that cannot be directly observed. Yet many option strategies, if they are to be successful, require a reasonable assessment of volatility. Therefore, an option trader needs some method of determining whether his expectations about volatility are being realized in the marketplace. Unlike directional strategies, whose success or failure can be immediately observed from current prices, there is no such thing as a current volatility. A trader must usually determine for himself whether he is using a reasonable volatility input into the theoretical pricing model. Previously, we estimated that for a $45 stock with an annual volatility of 37 percent, a one standard deviation price change is approximately $1.04. Suppose that over five days we observe the following daily settlement price changes: +$0.98,  –$0.65,  –$0.70,  +$0.25,  –$0.85  Are these price changes consistent with a 37 percent volatility? We expect to see a price change of more than $1.04 (one standard deviation) about one day in three. Over five days, we would expect to see at least one day, and perhaps two days, with a price change greater than one standard deviation. Yet, during this five-day period, we did not see a price change greater than $1.04 even once. What conclusions can be drawn from this? One thing seems clear: these five price changes do not appear to be consistent with a 37 percent volatility. Before making any decisions, we ought to consider any unusual conditions that might be affecting the observed price changes. Perhaps this was a holiday week, and as such, it did not reflect normal market activity. If this is our conclusion, then 37 percent may still be a reasonable volatility estimate. On the other hand, if we can see no logical reason for the market being less volatile than predicted by a 37 percent volatility, then we may simply be using the wrong volatility. If we come to this conclusion, perhaps we ought to consider using a lower volatility that is more consistent with the observed price changes. If we continue to use a volatility that is not consistent with the actual price changes, then we have the wrong volatility. If we have the wrong volatility, we have the wrong probabilities. And if we have the wrong probabilities, we are generating incorrect theoretical values, thereby defeating the purpose of using a theoretical pricing model in the first place. Admittedly, five days is a very small number of price changes, and it is unlikely that a trader will rely heavily on such a small sample. If we flip a coin five times and it comes up heads each time, we may not be able to draw any definitive conclusions. But if we flip the coin 50 times and it comes up heads every time, now we might conclude that there is something wrong with the coin. In the same way, most traders prefer to see larger price samplings, perhaps 20 days, or 50 days, or 100 days, before drawing any dramatic conclusions about volatility. Exactly what volatility is associated with the five price changes in the foregoing example? Without doing some rather involved arithmetic, it is difficult to say. 80  (The answer is actually 27.8 percent.) However, if a trader has some idea of the price changes he expects, he can easily see that the changes over the five-day period are not consistent with a 37 percent volatility.4 We have used the phrase price change in conjunction with our volatility estimates. Exactly what do we mean by this? Do we mean the high/low during some period? Do we mean open-to-close price changes? Or is there another interpretation? Although various methods have been suggested to estimate volatility, the most common method for exchange-traded contracts has been to calculate volatility based on settlement-to-settlement price changes. Using this approach, when we say that a one standard deviation daily price change is $1.04, we mean $1.04 from one day’s settlement price to the next day’s settlement price. The high/low or open/close price range may have been either more or less than this amount, but it is the settlement-to-settlement price change on which we focus.5  A Note on Interest-Rate Products For some interest-rate products, primarily Eurocurrency interest-rate futures, the listed contract price represents the interest rate associated with that contract, expressed as a whole number, subtracted from 100.6 If the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the interest paid on dollar deposits outside the United States, is 7.00 percent, the associated Eurodollar futures contract traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will be trading at 100 – 7.00 = 93.00. If Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), the interest paid on euro deposits outside the European Economic Union, is 4.50 percent, the associated Euribor futures contract traded at the London International Financial Futures Exchange will be trading at 100 – 4.50 = 95.50. Volatility calculations for these contracts are done using the rate associated with the contract (the rate volatility) rather than the price of the contract (the price volatility). If a Eurodollar futures contract is trading at 93.00 with a volatility of 26 percent, an approximate daily and weekly one standard deviation price change is (100 − 93) ×  26% ≈ 0.11 16  (daily standard deviation)  (100 − 93) ×  26% ≈ 0.25 7.2  (weekly standard deviation)  A price change greater than two standard deviations will occur about 1 time in 20. Because there are approximately 20 trading days in a month, as an additional benchmark, most traders expect to see a daily two standard deviation occurrence about once a month. 5 Alternative methods of estimating volatility have also been proposed when trading is continuous or when there is no well-defined daily settlement price. See, for example, Michael Parkinson, “The Extreme Value Method of Estimating the Variance of the Rate of Return,” Journal of Business 53(1):61–64, 1980; Mark B. Garman and Michael J. Klass, “On the Estimation of Security Price Volatilities from Historical Data,” Journal of Business 53(1):67–78, 1980; and Stan Beckers, “Variance of Security Price Returns Based on High, Low, and Closing Prices,” Journal of Business 56(1):97–112, 1983. 6 This method of quoting Eurocurrency contracts is used so that moves in Eurocurrency contracts will tend to mimic moves in bond prices. If interest rates rise, both bond prices and Eurocurrency futures will fall; if interest rates fall, both bond prices and Eurocurrency futures will rise. 4  10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cTo be consistent, if we index Eurodollar futures prices from 100, we must also index exercise prices from 100. Therefore, a 93.00 exercise price in our pricing model is really a 7.00 percent (100 – 93.00) exercise price. This transformation also requires us to reverse the type of option, changing calls to puts and puts to calls. To see why, consider a 93.00 call. For this call to go into the money, the underlying contract must rise above 93.00. But this requires that interest rates fall below 7.00 percent. Therefore, a 93.00 call in listed terms is the same as a 7.00 percent put in interest-rate terms. A model that is correctly set up to evaluate options on Eurodollar or other types of indexed interest-rate contracts will make this transformation automatically. The price of the underlying contract and the exercise price are subtracted from 100, with listed calls treated as puts and listed puts treated as calls. This type of transformation is not required for most bonds and notes. Depending on the coupon rate, the prices of these products may range freely without upper limit, often exceeding 100. Exchange-traded options on bond and note futures are therefore most often evaluated using a traditional pricing model. However, interest-rate products present other problems that may require specialized pricing models. It is possible to take an instrument such as a bond and calculate the current yield based on its price in the marketplace. If we were to take a series of bond prices and from these calculate a series of yields, we could calculate the yield volatility, that is, the volatility based on the change in yield. We might then use this number to evaluate the theoretical value of an option on the bond, although to be consistent we would also have to specify the exercise price in terms of yield. Because it is possible to calculate the volatility of an interest-rate product using these two different methods, interest-rate traders usually make a distinction between yield volatility (the volatility calculated from the current yield on the instrument) and price volatility (the volatility calculated from the price of the instrument in the marketplace).  Lognormal Distributions Thus far we have assumed that the prices of an underlying instrument are normally distributed. Is this a reasonable assumption? Beyond the question of the exact distribution of prices in the real world, the normal distribution assumption has one serious flaw. A normal distribution is symmetrical. For every possible upward move in the price of an underlying instrument, there must be the possibility of a downward move of equal magnitude. If we allow for the possibility of a $50 contract rising $75 to $125, we also must allow for the possibility of the contract dropping $75 to a price of –$25. But negative prices are clearly not possible for traditional stocks or commodities. We have defined volatility in terms of the percent changes in the price of an underlying instrument. In this sense, an interest rate and volatility are similar in that they both represent a rate of return. The primary difference between interest and volatility is that interest accrues only at a positive rate, whereas volatility is a combination of positive and negative rates of return. If we invest money at a fixed interest rate, the value of the principal will always grow. 82  However, if we invest in an underlying instrument with a volatility other than zero, the instrument may go up or down in price, resulting in either a profit (a positive rate of return) or a loss (a negative rate of return). A rate-of-return calculation must specify not only the rate that is being used but also the time intervals over which the returns are calculated. Suppose that we invest $1,000 for one year at an annual interest rate of 12 percent. How much will we have at the end of one year? The answer depends on how the 12 percent interest on our investment is paid out. Rate of Payment  Value after One Year  Total Yield  12% once a year  $1,120.00  12.00%  6% twice a year  $1,123.60  12.36%  3% every three months  $1,125.51  12.55%  1% every month  $1,126.83  12.68%  12%/52 every week  $1,127.34  12.73%  12%/365 every day  $1,127.47  12.75%  12% compounded continuously  $1,127.50  12.75%  As interest is paid more frequently, even though it is paid at the same rate of 12 percent per year, the total yield on the investment increases. The yield is greatest when interest is paid continuously. In this case, it is just as if interest is paid at every possible moment in time. Although less common, we can do the same type of calculation using a negative interest rate. For example, suppose that we make a bad investment of $1,000 and lose money at a rate of 12 percent annually (interest rate = –12%). How much will we have at the end of a year? The answer, again, depends on the frequency at which our losses accrue. Rate of Payment  Value after One Year  Total Yield  –12% once a year  $880.00  –12.00%  –6% twice a year  $883.60  –11.64%  –3% every three months  $885.29  –11.47%  –1% every month  $886.38  –11.36%  –12%/52 every week  $886.80  –11.32%  –12%/365 every day  $886.90  –11.31%  –12% compounded continuously  $886.92  –11.31%  In the case of a negative interest rate, as losses are compounded more frequently, even though at the same rate of –12 percent per year, the smaller the total loss, and consequently, the smaller the negative yield. 10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cIn the same way that interest can be compounded at different intervals, volatility can also be compounded at different intervals. The Black-Scholes model is a continuous-time model. The model assumes that volatility is compounded continuously, just as if the price changes in the underlying contract, either up or down, are taking place continuously but at an annual rate corresponding to the volatility associated with the contract. When the percent price changes are normally distributed, the continuous compounding of these price changes will result in a lognormal distribution of prices at expiration. Such a distribution is shown in Figure 6-7. The entire distribution is skewed toward the upside because upside price changes (a positive rate of return) will be greater, in absolute terms, than downside price changes (a negative rate of return). In our interest-rate example, a continuously compounded rate of return of +12 percent yields a profit of $127.50 after one year, whereas a continuously compounded rate of return of –12 percent yields a loss of only $113.08. If the 12 percent is a volatility, then a one standard deviation upward price change at the end of one year is +$127.50, whereas a one standard deviation downward price change is –$113.08. Even though the rate of return is a constant 12 percent, the continuous compounding of 12 percent yields different upward and downward moves. Note also the location of the mean of the distributions in Figure 6-7. The mean can be thought of as the “balance point” of the distribution. For a normal distribution, the peak of the distribution, or mode, and the mean have the same location, exactly in the middle of the distribution. But in a lognormal distribution the right tail, which is open-ended, is longer than the left tail, which is bounded by zero. Because there is more “weight” to the right of the peak, the mean of the lognormal distribution must be located to the right of the peak.  Figure 6-7  Normal distribution  Lognormal distribution Normal mean  0  –∞  84  Lognormal mean  Price distribution at expiration  +∞  Continuous rates of return can be calculated using the exponential function,7 denoted by either exp(x) or ex. In the preceding examples, $1,000 × e0.12 = $1,127.50  and  $1,000 × e–0.12 = $886.92  No matter how large the negative interest rate, continuous compounding precludes the possibility of an investment falling below zero because it is impossible to lose more than 100 percent of an investment. Consequently, in a lognormal distribution, the value of the underlying instrument is bounded by zero on the downside. Clearly, this is a more realistic representation of the real world than a normal distribution. We can see the effect of using a lognormal distribution rather than a normal distribution by considering the value of a 90 put and 110 call with a forward price of 100 for the underlying contract with six months to expiration and a volatility of 30 percent Contract  Value if Price Distribution Is Normal  Value if Price Distribution Is Lognormal  90 put  4.37  4.00  110 call  4.37  4.74  Under a normal distribution assumption, both the call and put have exactly the same value because they are both 10 percent out of the money. But under the lognormal distribution assumption in the Black-Scholes model, the 110 call will always have a greater value than the 90 put. The value of the 110 call can potentially appreciate without limit because the price of the underlying contract has no limit on the upside. The 90 put, however, can only rise to a maximum value of 90 because the price of the underlying contract can never fall below zero. Of course, the values in the preceding example are true only in theory. There is no law that prevents the 90 put from trading at a price greater than the 110 call. Indeed, such price relationships occur in many markets for a variety of reasons that we will discuss later. However, one possible explanation is that the marketplace disagrees with the assumptions on which the model is based. Perhaps the marketplace believes that a lognormal distribution is not an accurate representation of possible prices. And perhaps the marketplace is right!  Interpreting Volatility Data When traders discuss volatility, even experienced traders may find that they are not always talking about the same thing. When a trader says that the volatility is 25 percent, this statement may take on a variety of meanings. We can avoid confusion in subsequent discussions if we define some of the different ways in It will be useful for an option trader to become familiar with the characteristics of the exponential function [ex or exp(x)] and its inverse, the logarithmic function [ln(x)]. These can be found in any algebra or finance text. 7  10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cwhich traders refer to volatility. We can begin by dividing volatility into two categories—realized volatility, which we associate with an underlying contract, and implied volatility, which we associate with options.  Realized Volatility The realized volatility is the annualized standard deviation of percent price changes of an underlying contract over some period of time.8 When we calculate realized volatility, we must specify both the interval at which we are measuring the price changes and the number of intervals to be used in the calculations. For example, we might talk about the 50-day volatility of an underlying contract. Or we might talk about the 52-week volatility of a contract. In the former case, we are calculating the volatility from the daily price changes over a 50-day period.9 In the latter case, we are calculating the volatility from the weekly price changes over a 52-week period. On a graph of realized volatility, each point represents the volatility over a specified period using price changes over a specified interval. If we graph the 50-day volatility of a contract, each point on the graph represents the annualized standard deviation of the daily price changes over the previous 50 days. If we graph the 52-week volatility, each point on the graph represents the annualized standard deviation of the weekly price changes over the previous 52 weeks. Traders may also refer to realized volatility in the future (future realized volatility) and realized volatility in the past (historical realized volatility). The future realized volatility is what every trader would like to know—the volatility that best describes the future distribution of price changes for an underlying contract. In theory, it is the future realized volatility over the life of the option that we need to input into a theoretical pricing model. If a trader knows the future realized volatility, he knows the right “odds.” When he feeds this number into a theoretical pricing model, he can generate accurate theoretical values because he has the right probabilities. Like the casino, he may lose in the short run because of bad luck, but in the long run, with the probabilities in his favor, the trader can be reasonably certain of making a profit. Clearly, no one knows what the future holds. However, if a trader intends to use a theoretical pricing model, he must try to make an estimate of future realized volatility. In option evaluation, as in other disciplines, a good starting point is historical data. What typically has been the historical realized volatility of a contract? If, over the past 10 years, the volatility of a contract has never been less than 10 percent nor more than 30 percent, a guess for the future volatility of either 5 or 40 percent hardly makes sense. This does not mean that either of these extremes is impossible. But based on past performance, and in the absence of any extraordinary circumstances, a guess within the historical limits of 10 and 30 percent is probably more realistic than a guess outside these limits. Of course, In order to turn price changes into continuously compounded returns, volatility is most often calculated using logarithmic price changes—the natural logarithm of the current price divided by the previous price. In most cases, there is little practical difference between the percent price changes and logarithmic price changes. 9 For exchange-traded contracts, volatility calculations using daily intervals typically include only business days because these are the only days on which prices can actually change. If there are five trading days per week, a 50-day volatility covers a period of approximately 10 weeks. 8  86  10 to 30 percent is still a very wide range. But at least the historical data offers a starting point. Additional information may help to further narrow the estimate. As option traders have come to appreciate the importance of volatility as an input into a pricing model, volatility forecasting models have been developed in an attempt to more accurately predict future realized volatility. If a trader has access to a volatility forecast that he believes is reliable, he will want to use this forecast to make a better decision as to the future realized volatility. We will put off a discussion of possible forecasting methods until later chapters. When we calculate volatility over a given period of time, we still have a choice of the time intervals over which to measure the price changes in the underlying contract. A trader might consider whether the choice of intervals, even if the intervals cover the same time period, might affect the results. For example, we might look at the 250-day volatility, the 52-week volatility, and the 12-month volatility of a contract. All volatilities cover approximately one year, but one is calculated from daily price changes, one from weekly price changes, and one from monthly price changes. For most underlying contracts, the interval that is chosen does not seem to greatly affect the result. It is possible that a contract will make large daily moves yet finish the week unchanged. However, this is by far the exception. A contract that is volatile from day to day is likely to be equally volatile from week to week or month to month. Figure 6-8 shows the 250-day realized volatility of the S&P 500 Index from 2003 through 2012, with the volatility calculated from price changes at three different intervals: daily, weekly, and every four weeks. The graphs are not identical, but they do seem to have similar characteristics. There is no clear evidence that using one interval rather than another results in consistently higher or lower volatility.

In a sense, the implied volatility represents the marketplace’s consensus of what the future realized volatility of the underlying contract will be over the life of the option. Consider a three-month 105 call on a stock that pays no dividend. If we are interested in purchasing this call, we might use a pricing model to determine the option’s theoretical value. For simplicity, let’s assume that the option is European (no early exercise) and that we will use the Black-Scholes model. In addition to the exercise price, time to expiration, and type, we also need the price of the stock, an interest rate, and a volatility. Suppose that the current stock price is 98.50, the three-month interest rate is 6.00 percent, and our best estimate of volatility over the next three months is 25 percent. When we feed this data into our model, we find that the option has a theoretical value of 2.94. However, when we check the price of the option in the marketplace, we find that the 105 call is trading very actively at a price of 3.60. How can we account for the fact that we think the option is worth 2.94, but the rest of the world seems to think that it’s worth 3.60? This is not an easy question to answer because there are many forces at work in the marketplace that cannot be easily identified or quantified. But one way we might try to answer the question is by making the assumption that everyone trading the option is using the same theoretical pricing model. If we make this assumption, the cause of the discrepancy must be a difference of opinion about one or more of the inputs into the model. Which inputs are the most likely cause? It’s unlikely to be either the time to expiration or the exercise price because these inputs are fixed in the option contract. What about the underlying price of 98.50? Perhaps we incorrectly estimated the stock price due to the width of the bid-ask spread. However, for most actively traded underlying contracts, it is unlikely that the spread will be wide enough to cause a discrepancy of 0.66 in the value of the option. In order to yield a value of 3.60 for the 105 call, we would actually have to raise the stock price to 100.16, and this is almost certainly well outside the bid-ask spread for the stock. Perhaps our problem is the interest rate of 6.00 percent. But interest rates are usually the least important of the inputs into a theoretical pricing model. In fact, we would have to make a huge change in the interest-rate input, from 6.00 to 13.30 percent, to yield a theoretical value of 3.60. This leaves us with one likely cause for the discrepancy—the volatility. In a sense, the marketplace seems be using a volatility that is different from 25 percent. To determine what volatility the marketplace is using, we can ask the following question: if we hold all other inputs constant (i.e., time to expiration, exercise price, underlying price, and interest rates), what volatility must we feed into our model to yield a theoretical value equal to the price of the option in the marketplace? In our example, we want to know what volatility will yield a value of 3.60 for the 105 call. Clearly, the volatility has to be higher than 25 percent, so we might begin to raise the volatility input into our model. 88  Figure 6-9  Exercise price (105)  Solving for the theoretical value:  Stock price (98.50) Interest rate (6.00%)  Pricing model  Time to expiration (3 months)  Theoretical value (2.94)  Volatility (25%)  Exercise price (105)  Solving for the implied volatility:  Stock price (98.50) Interest rate (6.00%)  Pricing model  Implied volatility (28.50%)  Time to expiration (3 months) Option price (3.60)  If we do, we find that at a volatility of 28.50 percent, the 105 call has a theoretical value of 3.60. The implied volatility of the 105 call—the volatility being implied to the underlying contract through the pricing of the option in the marketplace—is 28.50 percent. When we solve for the implied volatility of an option, we are assuming that the theoretical value (the option’s price), as well as all other inputs except volatility, are known. In effect, we are running the theoretical pricing model backwards to solve for the unknown volatility. In practice, this is easier said than done because most theoretical pricing models do not work in reverse. However, there are a number of relatively simple algorithms that can quickly solve for the implied volatility when all other inputs are known. Implied volatility depends not only on the inputs into the theoretical pricing model but also on the theoretical pricing model being used. For some options, different models can yield significantly different implied volatilities. Problems can also arise when the inputs are not contemporaneous. If an option has not traded for some time and market conditions have changed, using an outdated option price will result in a misleading or inaccurate implied volatility. Suppose in our example that the price of 3.60 for the 105 call reflected the last trade, but that trade took place two hours ago when the underlying stock price was actually 99.25. At a stock price of 99.25, the implied volatility of the option, at a price of 3.60, is actually 26.95 percent. This underscores 10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cthe importance of accurate and contemporaneous inputs when calculating implied volatilities. Brokerage firms and data vendors who provide option analysis for their clients will typically include implied volatility data. The data may incorporate implied volatilities for every option on an underlying contract, or the data may be in the form of one implied volatility that is representative of options on a particular underlying market. In the latter case, the single implied volatility is usually the result of weighting the individual implied volatilities by some criteria, such as volume of options traded or open interest, or, as is most common, by assigning the greatest weight to the at-the-money options. Implied volatility in the marketplace is constantly changing because option prices, as well as other market conditions, are constantly changing. It is as if the marketplace were continuously polling all the participants to come up with a consensus volatility for the underlying contract for each expiration. This is not a poll in the true sense because the traders do not confer with each other and then vote on the correct volatility. However, as bids and offers are made, the price at which an option is trading will represent an equilibrium between supply and demand. This equilibrium can be expressed as an implied volatility. While the term premium really refers to an option’s price, because the implied volatility is derived from an option’s price, traders sometimes use premium and implied volatility interchangeably. If the current implied volatility is high by historical standards or high relative to the recent historical volatility of the underlying contract, a trader might say that premium levels are high; if implied volatility is unusually low, he might say that premium levels are low. New option traders are taught, quite sensibly, to sell overpriced options and buy underpriced options. By selling options at prices higher than theoretical value or buying options at prices lower than theoretical value, a trader creates a positive theoretical edge. But how should a trader determine the degree to which an option is overpriced or underpriced? This sounds like an easy question to answer. Isn’t the amount of the mispricing equal to the difference between the option’s price and its value? The question arises because there is more than one way to measure this difference. Returning to our example of the 105 call, we might say that with a theoretical value of 2.94 and a price of 3.60, the 105 call is 0.66 overpriced. But in volatility terms the option is 3.50 volatility points overpriced because its theoretical value is based on a volatility of 25 percent (our volatility estimate), while its price is based on a volatility of 28.50 percent (the implied volatility). Given the unusual characteristics of options, it is often more useful for a trader to consider an option’s price in terms of implied volatility rather than total points. Implied volatility is often used by traders to compare the relative pricing of options. In our example, the 105 call is trading at 3.60 with an implied volatility of 28.50 percent. Suppose that a 100 call under the same conditions is trading at 5.40. In total points, the 100 call is clearly more expensive than the 105 call (5.40 versus 3.60). But if, at a price of 5.40, the 100 call has an implied volatility of 27.51 percent, most traders will conclude that in theoretical terms the 100 call is almost a full percentage point less expensive (27.51 percent versus 28.50 percent) than the 105 call. Traders, in fact, talk about implied volatility as if it were the price of an option. A trader who buys the 100 call at a price 90  of 5.40 might say that she bought the call at 27.51 percent. A trader who sells the 105 call at a price of 3.60 might say that he sold the call at 28.50 percent. Of course, options are really bought and sold in the appropriate currency. But from an option trader’s point of view the implied volatility is often a more useful expression of an option’s price than its actual price in currency units. Even if the implied volatility of the100 call is 27.51 percent and the implied volatility of the 105 call is 28.50 percent, this does not necessarily mean that a trader ought to buy the 100 call and sell the 105 call. A trader also will need to consider what will happen if his estimate of volatility turns out to be incorrect. If the future realized volatility over the life of the options turns out to be 25 percent, both the 100 call and the 105 call are overpriced, and the sale of either option should, in theory, result in a profit. But what will happen if the trader’s volatility estimate is wrong, and the future realized volatility turns out to be 32 percent? Now the sale of either option will result in a loss. The consequences of being wrong about volatility are an important consideration, and this is something we will look at more closely in subsequent chapters. However, in the absence of other considerations, the lower implied volatility of the 100 call suggests that it is likely to be the better value. Although option traders may at times refer to any of the various interpretations of volatility, two of these stand out in importance—the future realized volatility and the implied volatility. The future realized volatility of an underlying contract determines the value of options on that contract. The implied volatility is a reflection of an option’s price. These two numbers, value and price, are what all traders, not just option traders, are concerned with. If a contract has a high value and a low price, a trader will want to be a buyer. If a contract has a low value and a high price, a trader will want to be a seller. For an option trader, this usually means comparing the expected future realized volatility with the implied volatility. If implied volatility is low with respect to the expected future volatility, a trader will prefer to buy options; if implied volatility is high, a trader will prefer to sell options. Of course, future volatility is an unknown, so a trader will look at historical and, if available, forecast volatility to help in making an intelligent guess about the future. In the final analysis, though, it is the future realized volatility that determines an option’s value. A commonly used analogy to help new traders better understand the role of volatility is to think of volatility as being similar to the weather. Suppose that a trader living in Chicago gets up on a July morning and must decide what clothes to wear that day. Will he consider putting on a heavy winter coat? This is probably not a logical choice because he knows that historically it is not sufficiently cold in Chicago in July to warrant wearing a winter coat. Next, he might turn on the radio or television to listen to the weather forecast. The forecaster is predicting clear skies with very warm temperatures close to 90°F (32°C). Based on this information, the trader has decided that he will wear a short-sleeve shirt and does not need a sweater or jacket. And he certainly won’t need an umbrella. However, just to be sure, he decides to look out the window to see what the people passing in the street are wearing. To his surprise, everyone is wearing a coat and carrying an umbrella. Through their choice of clothing, the people outside are implying different weather than the forecast. Given the conflicting information, 10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cwhat clothes should the trader wear? He must make some decision, but whom should he believe, the weather forecaster or the people in the street? There can be no certain answer because the trader will not know the future weather until the end of the day. Much will depend on the trader’s knowledge of local conditions. Perhaps the trader lives in an area far removed from where the weather forecaster is located. Then he must give added weight to local conditions. The decision on what clothes to wear, like every trading decision, depends on a great many factors. Not only must the decision be made on the basis of the best available information, but the decision must also be made with consideration for the possibility of error. What are the benefits of being right? What are the consequences of being wrong? If a trader fails to take an umbrella and it rains, this may be of little consequence if the bus picks him up right outside his residence and drops him off right outside his place of work. On the other hand, if he must walk several blocks in the rain, he might become sick and have to miss several days of work. The choices are never easy, and one can only hope to make the decision that will turn out best in the long run. Changing our assumptions about volatility can often have a dramatic effect on the value of an option. Figure 6-10 shows the prices, theoretical values, and implied volatilities for several gold options on July 31, 2012. Figure 6-11 focuses specifically on how these values change as we increase volatility from 14 to 18 percent. Looking for the moment at call values, although all the options increase in value, the 1600 call, the at-the-money option, increases the most, rising from 41.65 to 51.60, a total of 9.95. At the same time, the 1800 call shows the greatest increase in percent terms. Its value more than triples from 0.78 to 3.05, a total increase of 291 percent. These are important principles to which we will return later but that are worth stating now: 1. In total points, a change in volatility will have a greater effect on an at-the-money option than on an equivalent in-the-money or out-ofthe-money option. 2. In percent terms, a change in volatility will have a greater effect on an out-of-the-money option than on an equivalent in-the-money or at-the-money option. These same principles apply to puts as well as calls. The 1600 put increases the most in total points, rising from 29.26 to 39.21, a total of 9.95. The 1400 put increases the most in percent terms, from 0.13 to 0.89, or 585 percent. No matter how one measures change, in-the-money options tend to be the least sensitive to changes in volatility. As an option moves deeply into the money, it becomes more sensitive to changes in the underlying price and less sensitive to changes in volatility. Because it is often volatility characteristics that investors and traders are looking for when they go into an options market, it should not come as a surprise that most of the trading volume in option markets is concentrated in at-the-money and out-of-the-money options, the options that are most sensitive to changes in volatility. 92  Figure 6-10 Gold eight-week (40 trading days) historical volatility.

In Figures 6-12 and 6-13, we can see that the same principles apply to longer-term options.

As we would expect, the December option values are greater than the October option values with the same exercise price. But look at the magnitude of the changes as we change volatility. For the same exercise price, in total points, the December (long-term) options always change more than the October (short-term) options. This leads to a third principle of option evaluation: 3. A change in volatility will have a greater effect on a long-term option than an equivalent short-term option. The reader may have noticed several interesting points in the foregoing figures. First, although implied volatilities may vary across exercise prices, calls and puts with the same exercise price and that expire at the same time have very similar implied volatilities. Second, when we change volatility, calls and 10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cFigure 6-11 July 31, 2012 October gold futures = 1612.4 Time to October expiration = 8 weeks (56 days) Interest rate = 0.50% Exercise Price  Volatility = 14%  Volatility = 18%  Net Change in Value  Percent Change in Value  1400  212.37  213.13  0.76  1500  116.05  121.01  4.96  4.00%  1600  41.65  51.6  9.95  24.00%  1700  8.08  15.28  7.2  89.00%  1800  0.78  3.05  2.27  291.00%  1400  0.13  0.89  0.76  585.00%  1500  3.74  8.7  4.96  133.00%  1600  29.26  39.21  9.95  34.00%  1700  95.61  102.82  7.21  8.00%  1800  188.23  190.51  2.28  1.00%  October calls <1%  October puts  puts with the same exercise price and time to expiration change by approximately the same amount. These characteristics are the result of an important relationship10 between calls and puts at the same exercise price, a relationship that we will examine in more detail in Chapter 15. Finally, we might ask how much the volatility of gold can change over an eight-week period? Is a 4 percentage point change a real possibility? In fact, from Figure 6-14, the eight-week historical volatility for the 3½ years leading up to July 2012, we can see that such changes are not at all uncommon. Given its importance, it is not surprising that serious option traders spend a considerable amount of time thinking about volatility. From the historical, forecast, and implied volatility, a trader must try to make an intelligent decision about future volatility. From this, he will try to choose option strategies that will be profitable when he is right but that will not result in a serious loss when he is wrong. Because of the difficulty in predicting volatility, a trader must always look for strategies that will leave the greatest margin for error. No trader will survive very long pursuing strategies based on a future volatility estimate of 20 percent if such a strategy results in a significant 10  94  Some readers may already be familiar with this relationship—put-call parity.

Given the shifts that occur in volatility, a 2 percentage point margin for error may be no margin for error at all. We have not yet concluded our discussion of volatility. But before continuing, it will be useful to look at option characteristics, trading strategies, and risk considerations. We will then be in a better position to examine volatility in greater detail.  10/10/14 2:29 PM  \\x0cFigure 6-13 July 31, 2012 December gold futures = 1614.6 Time to December expiration = 17 weeks (119 days) Interest rate = 0.50% Exercise Price  Volatility = 14%  Volatility = 18%  Net Change in Value  Percent Change in Value  1400  216.03  220.06  4.03  2%  1500  126.41  136.59  10.18  8%  1600  58.78  73.31  14.53  25%  1700  20.71  33.52  12.81  62%  1800  5.44  13.03  7.59  140%  1400  1.78  5.81  4.03  226%  1500  12.00  22.18  10.18  85%  1600  44.20  58.74  14.54  33%  1700  105.98  118.79  12.81  12%  1800  190.54  198.13  7.59  4%  December calls  December puts  Figure 6-14 Gold eight-week (40 trading days) historical volatility. 40% 35% 30% 25% 20% 15% 10% 5% 0% Jan-09  96  Jul-09  Jan-10  Jul-10  Jan-11  Jul-11  Jan-12  Jul-12  '"
