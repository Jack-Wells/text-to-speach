      "P ab P cd QC ef T gfm JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComePrefaceT he number of available exchangetraded funds ETFs and the quantity ofassets underlying them has been growing exponentially in recent years.An important element for the future growth of the industry is the needfor new users of these products to understand how to execute trades in thebroad range of ETFs. Educating a new and expanding client base has becomea universal endeavor among ETF issuers. Even the largest ETF providersin the industry have products that do not trade the high volumes of thefew most popular products. Yet in order for the client base to utilize thebroader range of available products, it needs to understand how to achievean efficient execution. Understanding the proper methods of valuing andtrading ETFs will enable investors to expand their product usage and willenable the trading community to provide the services necessary to nurturethe future growth of this young industry. The ETF Handbook presents thetools necessary for valuing these funds and the concepts required for tradingand executing ETF order flow. This information will be important for bothtraders and the investor base to gain a true understanding of how theseproducts function in the markets.ETFS IN THE REAL WORLDJust recently I encountered two examples that clearly demonstrate the needfor this information. In the first, I received a call from a client seekinghelp in executing ETF order flow. The adoption of the ETF product byan expanding user base has created a flood of such client calls to productissuers. The clients initial comments were Ive been trying to buy twoof your ETFs and the intraday volume is very light. I have been biddingfor the shares for about a week and I havent been getting any executions.Can you help me This was not the first time I had heard this request. Ihave been dealing with similar inquiries for the past  years in the ETFindustry. In the early years, the questions involved helping the new product adopters, primarily institutions and hedge funds, in achieving desiredliquidity.ixP ab P cd QC ef T gfm JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Comex PREFACEOver the last several years, I have found myself in the role of champion of the smaller investor, helping advisors and our broader client baseachieve their desired executions in a broad suite of ETFs. The first thingI do in this situation is attempt to understand what the clients have beendoing so far and what their investment goals are. In this case, the clientwas an advisor trying to buy , shares each of two of our ETFsthat each trade approximately , shares daily. The typical market thatwould be quoted on the ETFs is roughly  cents wide with approximately shares on either side of the market. Without a solid understanding ofhow the ETF market works, one might think this would be a multiday trading adventure or, worse, a hopeless situation. It is far from that, however,and I was able to help the client achieve a very satisfactory execution. Ilearned that the client was placing very small limit orders on the bid side ofthe market. Then, every time the market starting moving down, he wouldlower his order price. By doing this, he never let liquidity providers see anyreal size to buy in the ETFs, and he never let his order get near the value ofthe ETF where opposing liquidity would be provided. This is the same assetting out in a boat to go fishing but never actually dropping a line in thewater with a hook and some bait. You may be out fishing, but you will notcatch any fish!The client and I then had a conversation about his investment goals.I explained to him how the valuation of an ETF is determined. I explainedthat in a lowvolume ETF, most of the trading will take place against aliquidity provider and that it is important to let the provider know you areout there and willing to trade at a price close to the ETF value for the providerto be willing to offer the desired liquidity. With that understanding in mind,we calculated that the fair value for each of the ETFs was approximately cents inside the offer side of the market at the time. So we did somethingthat seemed very radical to the client We decided to show our whole handto the world electronically. Instead of bidding for just  shares at a time,the client put a bid in each ETF in the system for all , shares at theprice he was willing to pay that was in line with the valuation of the ETF.The ETF marketplace has grown so broad that you sometimes need todo something to trigger the alerts on trading systems in order to trade. Thisis analogous to a bell being attached to the door of a store so the proprietorcan hear clients coming in and out. When the large bid showed up in ETFsthat did not trade very much daily volume, the liquidity providers werealerted via their systems. Sometimes, if I see a large bid or offer show up inone of my products, I will call the liquidity providers myself to make surethey are aware of this trading opportunity. We did not adjust our price basedon small market movements, interpreting them as noise within our strategy.This clients intention was to place a longerterm trade with a significantP ab P cd QC ef T gfm JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComePreface xiupside goal. He was indifferent as to whether he paid . or ., buthe had been adjusting his pricing as the market moved around. This kepthim constantly under the fair value level that would enable his order to besatisfied. The upshot of this situation was that both of his large orders werefilled almost immediately.His executions make sense for several reasons. First, he was biddinga level in the ETF that was considered to be fair value by the liquidityproviding community, and he showed enough size to attract some attention.The client was very satisfied with the executions. He had achieved the exposure he was looking for in the ETFs at a price that he was comfortablepaying. He had not initially understood where the liquidity came from butwas now comfortable with a method that he could use to get in and outof his positions in an acceptable manner. There are many intricate detailssurrounding the circumstances of achieving executions in your ETF orders.What is even more important to understand, however, are the concepts ofwhat is happening in the marketplace. All of those details are available inthis ETF Handbook.The second example shows the client achieving exposure via an alternatesolution. I received a call from a very large institution indicating that it likedthe methodology behind our ETFs and wanted to make some purchases.It had heard about the potential liquidity available in ETFs and wantedto learn more about the ways of executing orders to achieve institutionalgoals. The caller did have some concerns because the ETFs the organizationwere interested in traded with very low average daily volume. Since thiswas a large institution, it wanted to buy several hundred thousand sharesof several ETFs that tended to trade fewer than , shares per day. Itsinvestment horizon was longer term, and it was indifferent as to whether ittraded today, the following day, or even over a few days if required.This type of order flow utilizes one of the most important facets of theETF structure the creation and redemption mechanism. This client had atrading relationship with a large brokerdealer who happened to be an Authorized Participant AP. Being an AP enables the brokerdealer to interactdirectly with the ETF issuer in the creation of new ETF shares. To achievethe desired execution, the client gave the AP the order to buy the ETFs ata price based on the net asset value NAV. The AP went into the markets,purchased the shares underlying the ETF, and delivered them to the issuer.In turn, the issuer delivered new ETF shares to the AP who then deliveredthem on to the client. The client was able to achieve an execution in line withthe net asset value of the funds without having an impact on the ETF pricein the marketplace. In this scenario, the average daily volume of the ETFwas irrelevant because the client never actually traded the shares in the secondary market. Executions of very large size can be accommodated in theP ab P cd QC ef T gfm JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Comexii PREFACEETF structure utilizing this method this ability has helped to facilitate theirgrowth. However, executions of smaller size can also be executed using thismethodology by accessing the liquidity aggregators and understanding howthat business works. The details of creations and redemptions and utilizingliquidity providers are found throughout this handbook because they arecritical functions of the entire ETF structure.WHAT YOU WILL F IND IN THIS BOOKThis book has three main parts that will appeal to different sections of theETF universe in various ways. Part One introduces the various differentstructures of exchangetraded products, the myriad methodologies underlying those products, and the ways of bringing them to the marketplace. PartOne is written from the perspective of my role within an ETF issuer. I havebeen working at an issuer for two years at the time of the writing of thisbook. I had been trading ETFs for more than  years prior to deciding tomove to the other side of the fence. A brief history of my interaction withthe ETF product is helpful before moving forward with the description ofthe book.Throughout the mid to late s, I was running the closed end fundbusiness at Bear Stearns in midtown Manhattan. I was facilitating customerorder flow and running a proprietary trading strategy pursuing discountarbitrage opportunities. I was also a frequent user of the Country Websproducts available at the time. Those products later became the basis forthe iShares singlecountry ETF product set. One day a salesman on the deskstood up and said to me, Ive got an order in a strange fund Ive never heardof, can you make a market Since that was my role at the time, I agreed.I was not well versed in the product but made a market in the QQQsNasdaq  Index Tracker to satisfy the clients request. Almost immediately I lost a very large amount of money in my trading portfolio. In researching what went wrong and how I lost the money, I learned much moreabout the product and became enthusiastic about this newer and uniqueinvestment vehicle. It was then that I began to realize the potential of thisproduct for the trading community and started to build an ETF business atBear Stearns. Even then I did not expect the volume and asset explosion wehave experienced in the last few years.At that time I had my entire career leveraged to the markets and tomy trading performance. I had always been a basket or fund trader andwas never very comfortable buying singlecompany stocks. To manage mypersonal portfolio, I invested in mutual funds, mostly plain vanilla ones.I was diligently dollar cost averaging a small amount every month andwatching it grow. When I got married in  and my wife and I proceededP ab P cd QC ef T gfm JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComePreface xiiito buy a house, I sold all of my mutual fund positions to provide a significantdown payment on the property. Two years later, when I had more money toinvest and the ETF trading business had really taken off, I realized I wouldnever buy a mutual fund again but would utilize only ETFs for investing.That was when I realized that this product makes great sense for the averageinvestor. I wanted to be involved in helping bring these products to marketand helping investors utilize them for their investing goals. That is whatplanted the seed for my move to a seat at a young and innovative ETF issuerseveral years later.Part One of this book presents many of the concepts related to bringingETFs to market and how they fit into the investing landscape. I have avoidedpresenting a history of the ETF or presenting every detail of the product mechanics since those topics are well covered by other books. Several of thosebooks are referenced throughout this text. I focus on topics and conceptsthat have not been previously discussed in detail and may not have beenfully understood unless the reader worked for a product issuer or had beena liquidity provider in the products themselves. I bring the insiders perspective to the investor with the hopes of creating a broader understanding forall interested parties.Part Two goes through the mechanics of calculating the fair value forthe products. I will discuss why an international ETF might be trading awayfrom its intraday indicative value IIV during the trading day. Part Twoalso details the types of products available in the commodities category andthe varying structures of the currency ETFs. The main styles of ETFs are thefocus of Part Two, which presents a framework for understanding how tovalue those products that will build the foundation for effectively executingETF order flow. The broader ETF trading community will also find value inthis part. I often speak with people who are interested in getting into the ETFbusiness they need an understanding of how the valuation process works.When an exchangetraded product moves to a premium, for instance, if youunderstand its underlying mechanism, you will know why this may haveoccurred and what may happen in the future.We are living through a revolution in the way people invest as demonstrated by the growth of the exchangetraded products. Never before haveso many different investment products been available to investors at theclick of a mouse via an electronic brokerage account. There is a leveling ofthe investing landscape taking place that is bringing the tools of the institutional universe to the masses. As with any material shift in mindset ornew product adoption, there are learning curves involved. The techniquesfor executing order flow in this investment vehicle are still not widely knownand understood. Yet they are crucial because a main feature of the product is its availability on an exchange like an ordinary stock. In Part ThreeI review many of the trading techniques being used today. I also look at someP ab P cd QC ef T gfm JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Comexiv PREFACEconcepts for trading ETFs that might develop in the future as the industrymatures. Additionally I take a look at the current market participants andthe roles they play in the industry. It is important to know who is doingwhat so you can interact properly with all the market participants. If youare managing money for clients utilizing ETFs, I would recommend readingPart Three first, and commiting it to memory, before moving on to the restof this book.Incredible growth and change is occurring in the universe of exchangetraded products every day. In the final part of the book, I provide someappendices that will lead you to the most current information available.The industry is well covered by a very knowledgeable media force. Journalists utilizing many different media chronicle the daily happenings in theETF world. I provide a list of Web sites with information on the products.I also provide a list of issuers and their Web page addresses. In addition, Iprovide a list of products in registration that will give you a taste of whatthe future could bring to bear and also exposes the holes that could somedaybe filled with burgeoning products. In an effort to tie this book to the age oftechnology in which we live, I have provided several of the spreadsheets thatI use for demonstrating the models, specifically calculating NAV and IIVand evaluating currency funds. In addition, Wiley has organized a link tomy webinar, which is focused exclusively on valuing and trading ETFs. Thewebinar gives a brief summary of the concepts detailed throughout this book.TRADING TIPThroughout the book you will see highlighted sections to bring attention to specific points regarding trading ETFs in the market.WHAT YOU WILL F IND ON THE COMPANIONWEB SITEThe companion Web site for this book located at www.wiley.comgoabnerthe password is abneretf contains five spreadsheets.

I bring to the reader, however,an insiders view of what is behind the curtain. The book is unique bothin its content and in its perspective. It will help as a guide to the properutilization of ETFs. The investing public deserves to know and understandthe details of how products work. The trading community will need to buildan infrastructure capable of handling the avalanche of ETF order flow tocome. It is my hope that readers will take advantage of the features of ETFsand enjoy many years of profitable investing and trading.DISCLAIMERThe concepts and ideas in this book are my own.

I am grateful for the many nights I havebeen allowed to remain on the trading desk long past the market close,puzzling over the results of my most recent trades. While my friends wereout enjoying life and my family ate dinner without me, I sought the counselof the nighttime cleaning crew. The mice, feasting on lunch crumbs andwires in the metal floors beneath my feet, joined me in my late hours onthe desk and attempted to answer my queries. I thank my bosses for theirdiligence in not giving me enough risk capital to trap myself and the firmin one of my marketinduced trading endeavors. And I especially thank myclients for continuing to believe in me and trust my intentions. My searchfor the answers has led to this ETF handbook. I hope it enables you timeoutside the office to view many sunsets with your family and friends.For certain parts of the book, I was able to tap people with particularspecialties. Ben Slavin was extremely instrumental in ensuring I had correctlypresented the structural issues. His universal knowledge of product structureand development was invaluable. Rick Harper was the guiding hand in thesection regarding his specialties of fixed income and currencies as well asa frequent latenight office companion. Although this book is a completelyseparate and distinct endeavor from my WisdomTree employment, dailyinteraction with the most knowledgeable and aggressive ETF team in theworld was extremely helpful in bringing this book to fruition. I have nevermet a more dedicated and hardworking group than the team at WisdomTree.Three people read every word of the unedited text Doug Loveland,Anita Rausch, and Lynne Cohen. Doug, during his several hours a day onthe train, was able to read, cross out, and rewrite large swaths of the text.Anita, an incredibly talented and experienced ETF trader, helped to clarifymany of the concepts and edit the original text. Once they were done, Lynnehelped to turn the text into words that would actually make sense to readers.Various other bits and pieces of the book were reviewed and edited byRick Rosenthal, James Chen, Evan Cohen, Andy McOrmond, and ImseokYang. These individuals have been involved with me, or the ETF world, formany years, and their collective pool of knowledge is unmatched. Beyondour various business relationships, we are all truly friends.xviiP ab P cd QC ef T gfm JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Comexviii ACKNOWLEDGMENTSI have recently learned that a Wiley book does not get printed withoutthe close guidance of editors and others. Pamela van Giessen had the foresight to see that this book would bring something to the market that is verydifferent from every other ETF book Wiley has published I cannot thankher enough. Emilie Herman suffered through my many changes, corrections, and writing inexperience to help make this book worthy of the greatWiley name. None of this would have been possible without James Altucherintroducing me to Pamela in the first place.Most important, nothing in my life happens without the love and support of my beautiful wife, Denise. I check to make sure she is sleeping nextto me every day when I awake, fearful that my wife and family are all justan incredibly detailed and wonderful dream. Luckily, as I write this, mychildren are still young enough to go to bed early and start every day as ifthe world is new, so I hope they have not missed me too much.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComePARTOneIntroduction to theETF MarketplaceT he process of dividing the current exchangetraded funds ETFs into categories of assets is not simple. Often ETFs fit reasonably well in multiplecategories. If you were to separate all the characteristics that could possiblybe categorized, you would have almost as many categories as funds andwould not have made an unwieldy group easier to manage. For instance, anETF that provides country access to a single nonU.S. country but does notuse the atypical market capitalization weighting structure might be placedinto either the international category or the fundamentally weighted category depending on the particular bias of the writer.I tried to use an agnostic method of categorizing the available typesof asset categories currently covered by the U.S.listed ETF market, shownin Exhibit I.. I tried to find the group of categories that present a clearoverarching view of what types of products are available in the ETF wrapperwithout becoming too granular into the various different strategies. There isno firm standard because of the diversity of available products. I have seenvarious renditions of this type of chart with both more and fewer categoriesdelineated. Exhibit I. shows the categories and their current respectiveassets and number of funds.In terms of current assets, the equity funds as a unit far outweigh any ofthe other categories. Overall, equitybased products make up approximately of ETF assets in the United States. This makes sense if you consider thatthe equity products came to market much earlier than the other categories,and the products are designed and listed within the realm of equity securities.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEEXHIB IT I .

Therefore, itwould not be surprising to see relative growth in those product lines as theiruse continues to evolve.Exhibit I. shows the breakdown of assets by category.The discussion of trading and valuing ETFs must begin with a look intothe genesis of the products. I aim to make this very brief since other booksoffer encyclopedic information regarding the specifics of product structureand initial product development. This text focuses on understanding howthe products work, how to value them, good trading practices, who arethe market participants, and how they are using the products. As Sun Tzuwrote in The Art of War, It is said that if you know your enemies andknow yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles. The financialmarkets are like a battleground Success comes from anticipating the movesof others. This book will help you understand the motives of the othermarket participants in the ETF arena.Part One focuses on how ETFs are brought to the market.

Chapter  investigates the legal requirements for listing funds, the various structures that are available, and why they are utilized. I alsohighlight where some structures have had difficulties. Chapter  discusses the intricacies of bringing products to market. Itis interesting to note that the ETF providers abide by the theory of Ifyou build it, they will come. They bear the initial expense of buildingproducts and bringing them to market without any commitment thatassets will be attracted to those funds. Chapter  compares three types of funds in the market ETFs, closedendfunds CEFs, and mutual funds. These products make up the cornerstone of investing for a large swath of the investing population. It iscritical to understand the nuances among the product types to utilizeany of them in an efficient manner.Part One concludes with a look at some of the expectations I have forthe ETF marketplace over the next decade. Much of the future growth ofP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEthe industry will be based around a solid understanding of effective productdevelopment. That is not simply the wrapping up of assets and calling themETFs but understanding the best methods of making products that truly servethe needs of investors. Part One provides the foundation that is necessaryfor the trading and investing community to understand why products tradein certain ways and how they can be properly valued. Throughout the rest ofthe book, we build on these concepts to uncover the details of valuation andto learn more about the market. An entirely new trading and developmentmechanism is growing around the ETF structure. Any firm involved in thefinancial markets should now be working to assess the marketplace and gainan understanding of how to get involved in this rapidly expanding business.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeCHAPTER Development of an ETFL aunching an exchangetraded fund ETF involves numerous decisions fora fund company. One of the first things that will need to be decided is whattype of market exposure will be offered by this new ETF. Once the underlyingexposure is determined, decisions can be made that involve choosing the bestmethods to provide that exposure to clients. This is when fund companiesdetermine which of the various structures will be used to bring the productto market. This book focuses on the ETF structure as separate and distinctfrom other exchangetraded products in the marketplace, but Chapter discusses the unique characteristics of these structures.Once the decision has been made as to what the underlying productset will be and in what structure the fund will be brought to market, thereare the details of building the actual ETF. The formation of the creationunit, the basket of shares that comprises the funds underlying constituents,is probably one of the most critical decisions in ETF development. Ensuringthat the basket underlying the ETF is transparent, liquid, and reasonablyeasy to trade has proven to be a consistent measure of product success inthe marketplace. ETFs are listed products that trade during the day on anexchange. One of the main concepts that you will read about throughoutthis book is the mechanism that keeps the ETF trading near its underlyingnet asset value NAV. The process of being able to create and redeem sharesin an ETF on a daily basis, and thus the fungibility between the ETF andits underlying basket, is a critical and distinguishing feature of the productsdesign.Throughout this chapter we tour the basic steps involved in bringing anETF to the marketplace. We look at decisions regarding whether a productwill be providing access or performance, whether it will become a passivelyor actively managed fund and what will be the universe of its underlyingconstituents. Then we get into the actual development of the ETF itself. Idiscuss the development of the basket for the creation unit, the creation andredemption process, and the Authorized Participant.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEThe creation and redemption process is discussed at the end of this firstchapter. It is presented early in the book because, when speaking abouttrading ETFs and understanding their value, almost nothing is as critical asunderstanding what is going on in the creation basket and the relationshipthat basket has to the ETF price and its liquidity. The creation and redemption mechanism of the ETF product line is the differentiating factor that hasbeen most responsible for its success.MARKET ACCESS OR OUTPERFORMANCEThe entire universe of ETFs can be boiled down to two essentially differentproduct goals those that provide access and those that offer some formof added performance metric. Although there are some blackandwhitedistinctions, there are also products that fit at different points along theproduct spectrum. In the product spectrum presented in Exhibit ., you cansee the pure products providing access or those providing active managementand then the products in the middle utilizing enhanced indexing and othermethods for achieving exposures.An access product is a tool that provides passive exposure to the ETFuser. The investor can attain exposure to a particular index, region, country, or sector by using an access product that typically tracks and tries toreplicate a benchmark of some kind. The ETF market has made available abroad range of investment products that enable investors to access types ofexposures only dreamed of previously. Never before was it practical to havean equitybased position in actual gold bullion in your investment account.Countries such as Vietnam, groups of global stocks representing specific sectors, and currencies from countries around the world are all available nowwithin the ETF wrapper.An ETF providing access to any form of defined exposure, such astracking an index, is considered to be a betatype product. A fund that istrying to outperform a specific benchmark would be considered an alphatype product.PerformanceAlphaAccessBetaIndexTrackersActivelyManaged FundsFundamental Weighting and RulesBased StrategiesEXHIB IT . Product Spectrum Index Tracking to Actively Managed ETFsP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeDevelopment of an ETF If an ETF is trying to provide something beyond pure tracking of atraditional benchmark index, it is considered to be a performance product.This type of product has become available only over the last few years. In theearlier days of ETF growth, the products were all designed as access vehiclescompeting against various other structures as tools for providing exposure.More recently ETFs have been moving across the spectrum attempting tooutperform the traditional benchmarks, thereby offering a trading strategywithin listed ETFs and providing new strategies for money managers to usein their portfolios.Performancetype products are attempting to provide more than a basicindex tracking tool. They are bringing to the market investment productsthat can be utilized to complete core or satellite portfolios and other strategies. Performance products that track new indexes are providing a form ofpassive alpha. They are not traded like actively managed funds but according to rulesbased mechanisms. The funds track the newly created indexrules, but within those rules are goals of outperformance, alpha. The newactively managed portfolios are attempting to provide an even purer levelof alpha, not tracking an index at all, while attempting to generate returnsthat outperform specified benchmarks.INDEX TRACKING OR ACTIVELY MANAGEDWhen initiating the process of creating a new ETF, one of the primaryconsiderations is to fully conceptualize what value you are trying to provideto the investing public. There are many different types of indexes, and theypursue many different methods of producing their desired results. Some takethe entire available community of a specified group in order to produce atracking mechanism. Others take a sampling of that same group and, byusing weighting optimizations and other screens, they create a reasonabletracking mechanism within most constraints.When creating an index on which to base an ETF, it is important todefine the actual goal of the index. Is it being designed to provide a uniquemeasurement of certain securities that have not historically been monitoredin this way Is the index being designed to track a benchmark or outperformit The index could be created with the goal of improving on indexes thatalready exist. An example of this would be the creation of an index usingfundamental screens in an attempt to outperform indexes based on marketcapitalization over time.Typically the firm creating an index is separate from the firm that issuesETFs. There are a few firms that have both an index creation and an ETFissuance group within the same infrastructure. This is interesting becauseP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEa typical index provider has different concerns from an ETF issuer. Partof the determination in the construction of the index will inevitably be theability to invest in the underlying products however, it is not always the firstconcern of an index provider. The product development teams in the ETFworld have been extremely creative in utilizing product structures to attainvarious exotic exposures. And in the places where they have determined thatthe exposure cannot be achieved via the typical route of index tracking, theyhave moved further toward actively managed vehicles.According to a white paper entitled ExchangeTraded Funds A Passive Past and an Active Future Without argument, the most interestingevent in the world of ETFs is the emergence of actively managed product. While this might be the slightly aggressive tone of an actively managed ETF provider, it sums up the feelings of many people, both insideand outside the ETF community, who eagerly anticipate the arrival of thesenew products in the marketplace. Actively managed ETFs free the products from their traditional tethers of replicating underlying indexes. In theirsimplest form, they enable ETF providers to produce products that aspireto outperform traditional benchmarks without the need for strict adherence to an index and its rules. Among the first products utilizing the activemanagement exemption were currency ETFs designed to achieve their exposures via actively managed portfolios of nondeliverable forwards and otherinstruments.Recently the market has begun to see the launch of products that arecomposed of baskets of securities actively managed by portfolio managerswho previously would have not been able to run their portfolios within theETF structure. These products are still in their infancy, and the directionsthat the active management exemption will take the ETF world are as yetstill unknown.UNDERLYING ASSETSFor an ETF to be effective and representative, it should consist of a group ofsecurities that are, in all reasonable circumstances, adhering to the overallgoal of the index or strategy and are diverse. There is usually going tobe several constituent cuts when developing the ETF basket. If you areconsidering an ETF composed of largecapitalization stocks, for instance,the following steps might occur. Cut the stocks with a defined minimal capitalization from the universeof all stocks to create the index.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeDevelopment of an ETF . Then cut the stocks with a minimal float or liquidity or any of a varietyof variables. You might use any number of variables to screen and cutconstituents.. Now you might have your index universe, and you proceed to create anindex and then an ETF.. The ETF might be a perfect replication of the index or just an optimizedcut, depending on underlying trading volumes and other potential constraints on creation basket constituents.The decision to optimize your ETF basket, further reducing its constituents, or to provide perfect replication is not something taken lightly.There are various benefits and detractions to each methodology. Two of thelargest ETF providers compete in many categories with similar funds thatcan be differentiated only on a basis of basket optimization versus perfectreplication. These decisions can lead to significant performance differencesover time.Notional value of the assets underlying both an index and its trackingETF is a very important consideration. If the universe is too small, it mightnot draw a broad enough investor audience or have enough underlyingliquidity to bring the product success. There have been several examplesthroughout the short history of ETFs where products have been listed andfailed to attract enough assets to continue growth. One reason for some ofthose failures might have been an extremely narrow goal that led to a highlyspecialized and small investment universe. This can lead to two distinctproblems a limited number of investors will have the desire or need toutilize the fund, and liquidity is unattainable because trading the underlyingconstituents of the funds can be very difficult.Throughout this book I discuss the activity of accessing liquidity of ETFsvia their underlying baskets. The notional assets of the underlying universeare an important factor that is closely related to actual ETF trading volumes.REBALANCING AND INDEX CHANGESAnother important consideration that comes into play during the development stages of both the indexes and the ETFs is the frequency of corporateactivity in the universe of constituents. Frequent changes to the baskets result in high trading costs and sometimes an inaccurate representation of thegoal of the index. Various analyses will be done on the chosen constituentsto determine the frequency of corporate actions, price volatility, weightingmovements, and dividend yields to create guidelines for the management ofthe index. Tracking an index with a limited number of constituents whoseP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEnames change on a weekly basis can become challenging and cost prohibitive. Constituent weighting needs to have a reasonable distribution tobe representative of the universe as well. If the basket skews too heavily to afew top stocks, then you will lose representation to the rest of the universe.This can lead to tracking issues and to a small number of names having anoverly strong influence on the product.A perfectly replicated basket will have the least tracking error as compared to the underlying index. Any existing error would result primarilyfrom friction costs of executing the basket in a real lifeexample and management fees. Additionally, similar to the index, there will inevitably besome form of rebalance mechanism to account for underlying changes inthe components for a variety of reasons. There are mergers and acquisitions,substantial changes to market capitalization, dividend size and frequency,as well as other changes to underlying equities that could create the need forsome form of rebalancing of both the index and the ETF basket.Some of the main considerations for creating the rules for rebalancingand tracking contradict each other. Although you may consider the underlying notional of an index for breadth, the fact that an index is not initiallyintended as a trading vehicle limits the concerns regarding the trading of itscomponents. In creating the ETF basket, however, trading is an extremelyimportant consideration. This is because in many ways the growth of theETF itself is dependent on the ability of that basket to be traded and delivered to the issuer. Additionally, although you may desire perfect indexreplication to limit tracking the spread between index and basket returns,at some point there must be a tradeoff between the complexity and limitedmarginal added value of having too many names in the basket versus howmuch you are willing to diverge from tracking perfection.ETF BASKETThe exchangetraded fund basket is really the central character in the entireproduction. It is called the creation unit, and it is used to facilitate theadvanced features of the product wrapper. The creation unit is the basketthat is published by the ETF issuer that is utilized for the inkind, or cash,transfer of constituent shares and ETF shares. The ETF basket aims to satisfythe important characteristics of transparency, liquidity, and tracking, andthese must all be considered within the constraints of basket development.Whereas an index may utilize the entire available universe within itsconstraints, in order for an ETF to have a viable basket, it is importantto examine further elements about the underlying components. Specifically,analysis should focus on the liquidity of those products and whether anP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeDevelopment of an ETF investor would be better off utilizing a smaller sampling of that universein order to satisfy the tradeoff between correlation and accessibility. Inaddition to liquidity, analysis should also focus on the individual weightsof the index constituents. The ETF structure does not really benefit fromweightings that are too large. And ETFs do not benefit from weightings thatare too small because that can increase the trading costs without relativeperformance value. In the case where there are a large number of constituentsat extremely small weights, to make the basket reasonable in terms of itsability to be traded using current methods of basket trading, it would beadvantageous to reduce the number of constituents in the basket.Creat ion Unit Determinat ionLet us look at some more particular points involved in the determinationof the creation unit. Price point of the ETF is very important for productpositioning. Typically it starts with a notional amount determination. Atthis point an analysis of the basket will be done at differing price points toassess the efficiency of trading the baskets constituents.The average trading volumes of the underlying constituents of an ETFbasket will be determinants in the potential future volumes of the ETF. Ateach step of determining the underlying universe and whittling it down tothe ETF creation basket will be some form of analysis of its underlyingconstituents. If the ETF structure is not being used, there is potentially somegreater leeway in the liquidity of the underlying baskets. Closedend fundsCEFs gained some of their popularity from their ability to invest in lessliquid assets because they do not have a daily issuance component. The ETFwrapper allows for the daily issuance and redemption of shares liquidity inthe underlying basket is important to facilitate these transactions.One of the main factors in determining the underlying basket will bethe volume analysis of the components. This is also done during rebalancesand at other times during the life of an ETF, not only during its initialdevelopment. I discuss the liquidity underlying an ETF via its basket in depthin Chapter , but let us take a look at some assessments of basket liquidity atthis stage. Exhibit . shows several things that would be potential problemsin an ETF creation unit basket.The first thing to highlight would be ticker BBB, the second name inthe basket, sorted alphabetically by ticker. This is an exceptional stock inthe basket because its daily average trading volume is very small comparedto the other constituents. Whereas the creation unit shares required for theother constituents are all less than  of their average daily trading volumeADV, in order to trade the required shares for BBB, you would have totrade fully  of its daily average volume. This is an outlier that couldP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeEXHIBIT.PotentialLiquidityConstraintsoftheUnderlyingBasketCreationSharesImpliedImpliedAverageUnitSharesperPercentPotentialPotentialLastDailyasPercentCreationWeightinETFSharesatETFUnitsatTickerPriceVolumeofADVUnitBasketADVADVAAA,..,,,BBB,.,.,CCC,..,,DDD,..,,,EEE,..,,,FFF,..,,GGG,.,.,,HHH,..,,,III,..,,,JJJ,..,,KKK,..,,LLL,.,.,,MMM,..,,NNN,..,,OOO,..,,,PPP,.,.,QQQ,.,.,,RRR,..,,SSS,..,,TTT,.,.,,AssetsperCU,.SharesperCU,NAV.SourceBloomberg.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeDevelopment of an ETF cause terrible potential liquidity issues for the ETF. If you look over tothe right of the grid, you can see that the Implied Potential ETF Shares at of ADV is only , shares. That number is a function of howmany shares are required for a creation unit that can be delivered during thecreation process. In the case of ticker BBB, because the required amount ofshares is so high compared to its ADV, it becomes a serious constraint onthe amount of ETF shares that potentially can be traded and created duringa day.In comparison, if you look at ticker III, you can see that the sharesrequired for a creation unit are very small compared to the stocks ADV.The implied ETF column shows that if it were the only stock in the basketand just  shares of it had to be traded to complete a creation unit, andif you restricted yourself to only  of the average daily volume of thestock, you still could trade enough in a day to create  million shares ofthe ETF. It is important to notice that the number really is , creationunits at , ETF shares per unit. Or to say it in another way, you couldtrade enough versions of the underlying basket to generate , creationunits yielding  million ETF shares. At a current NAV value of .,this implies that the ETF could potentially trade roughly . billion of ETFshares in a day  million  .. However, because there are other stocksin the basket, ticker symbol BBB would restrict the daily trading notionalin the ETF to approximately ,. This is a significant restriction tothe trading of the underlying basket in this ETF it shows how you typicallycalculate the potential liquidity of the ETF by its least liquid component. Itwould be better for the ETF if BBB had been screened out of the underlyingbasket.Something else that stands out in this ETF basket is the weight of tickerPPP in the overall portfolio. Ticker PPP is showing a weight of .of the basket. This one stock comprises almost  of the basket, leavingit significantly overweighted compared to the other names in the basket.Typically an ETF has some form of regular rebalance that counteracts theeffects of large weights due to price moves, which can potentially causesignificant weighting imbalances in a fund. Some products on the market,however, do not rebalance their portfolios and end up with highly concentrated weights in a select number of names, which can become a constrainton the performance of the basket as a whole.Beyond having an effect on the performance of the underlying ETF,weighting and liquidity determine the viability of the creation unit. This isthe lifeline of an ETF that enables it to grow its assets under managementAUM. This makes the product viable and valuable for investors and profitable for the issuers. Those are the two mutually dependent goals of anygood investment product.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACECreat ion and Redempt ion ProcessThe creation and redemption process sometimes is misunderstood by the newer client base involved in the ETF product line.It is important to understand that the creation and redemptionprocess is a function of the primary market and that this processfacilitates the accessing of underlying liquidity in an ETF.When ETFs are traded on an exchange, they are considered to be tradingin the secondary market. The primary market is one of issuance. In an initialpublic offering IPO, shares initially are issued in the primary market, andthey begin trading in the secondary market. That is the case with an ETFas well, except that an ETF via the daily creation and redemption processhas what is called continuous issuance. When an Authorized ParticipantAP does a creation, the requisite shares matching the creation unit aredelivered to the issuer, along with the required cash component, and theissuer delivers the AP shares of the ETF. The issuer does not maintain aninventory of shares that it delivers to the AP, but as part of the creationprocess, the issuer issues new ETF shares. These new shares are reflectedin the shares outstanding number of the ETF that is published daily. In anopposite situation, when the AP processes a redemption order, shares ofTRADING TIPThe inkind transfer of stocks that is utilized in the creation and redemption process is the delivery of the stocks in the creation basketone way and the delivery of ETF shares in the opposite direction.Cash is not delivered to the ETF issuer except under certain circumstances. The inkind process enables the fund to take in the stocksit needs for new investments without having to go into the marketand purchase those shares. And the redemption process enables thefund to disburse the basket of stocks it no longer needs because thereare fewer assets in the fund. This process is not considered to be atrade and has very important repercussions for management of thefund portfolio. One important feature is that it enables the portfolio manager to manage the cost basis of assets in the portfolio.Throughout the book we discuss various other benefits of this uniquefacility.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeDevelopment of an ETF the ETF are delivered to the issuer, and the issuer delivers the underlyingbasket to the AP. Again these deliveries would also include the stipulatedcash component amount. In this case, however, the issuer does not holdonto those shares or put them in some inventory rather, those shares aretheoretically destroyed. This means that they are no longer outstandingin the marketplace, and the assets under management AUM of the ETFwould decrease.Exhibit . shows a very basic diagram of the creation process. In itssimplest form, the AP is delivering a basket of shares to the issuer and theissuer is delivering shares of the ETF. These transactions are not consideredofficial trades, and they do not report to the consolidated tape. They areinkind transactions, an exchange of one for the other. The ETF issuer inthis basic example is not trading any shares in the markets but is receivingthem from the AP.I have deliberately made this diagram extremely simple because I wantmarket participants to understand the basic nature of the transaction firstand then its ramifications later. This seemingly simple process enables thetrading of millions of shares of ETFs at price levels right around NAV, andit is changing the underlying nature of the financial markets. It also enablesETF portfolio managers to manage their portfolios in a taxefficient mannerwith which many other product wrappers cannot compete.Exhibit . shows the process in reverse. In this case the ETF issuer isdelivering the stocks in the underlying basket to the AP. This inkind deliveryof stocks from the ETF portfolio is the key to letting ETF portfolio managersmanage gains and losses. It enables them to reduce any potential capital gainsin the portfolio that might have occurred from rebalance trading or othercorporate actions. Unlike reportable portfolio transactions these exchangesare not considered taxable events for the ETF.The Authorized Participant Delivers a Basket of Stocks to the Issuer.The Issuer Delivers the Shares of the ETF to the AP.These Are InKind Transactions.AuthorizedParticipantETF IssuerCreation Basket SharesETF SharesEXHIB IT .

Simplified Redemption ProcessDelivering and receiving inkind shares is a process whereby the APacts as the executionandtrading agent of the underlying shares. It is theresponsibility of the AP to either purchase the shares in the market or borrowthose shares to deliver to the issuer. The inkind shares exchange is the issuereither receiving or delivering shares in exchange for doing the reverse inthe ETF shares. This is acceptable because the shares are fungible vehicles,interchangeable for each other. This process removes the expense of tradingfrom the ETF when there is a growth or decrease in assets. It also enablesthe ETF to attain a high level of tax efficiency because it is able to divest itsportfolio of shares without trading them in the marketplace and generating ataxable event. Because of this ability, capital gains distributions are typicallyvery low or nonexistent in many ETFs. By contrast, a mutual fund that isfacing the redemption of a large seller of assets will be required to go outand sell assets from the fund so that it can deliver cash to the redeemer. Thiscan generate trading expenses to the fund and also generate taxable eventsin the form of gains from stocks that have been bought and must now besold in the marketplace. In the ETF structure, most trading expenses due toasset growth and shrinkage are the responsibility of each individual investorand are not borne by all shareholders.I have presented the pictures of the simple creations and redemptions because I am going to expand on the important specific features of the processesthroughout this chapter and the rest of the book. Many of the graphical versions of this process bring in surrounding aspects that hide the effect of whatis actually happening. At various points throughout the book, we will seeadditions to these basic charts to account for surrounding events, such asclient involvement on one side and market trading on the other.Almost every facet of the success of the ETF wrapper can be tracedback to the process of the creation and redemption of shares. The two maincompeting products, closedend funds and mutual funds, have very differentmethods of issuing and redeeming shares. The CEF issues shares via an IPO,and once it is listed, it is perpetual. Unless there is some form of activistP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeDevelopment of an ETF event or other event that causes the CEF to liquidate, its shares will remainlisted on the exchange. A mutual fund never lists its shares on the exchange.It takes in cash directly from customers and issues shares directly to thosecustomers. In the case of a redemption order, a mutual fund cancels sharesoutstanding and delivers cash to the customer. In both, the case of a CEFlisting via an IPO and a mutual fund issuing new shares, the funds portfoliomanagers put the cash that they have received to work in the markets viatrading. ETF portfolio managers do not trade into their baskets of securitiesthey are delivered to them via their registered counterparts, the AuthorizedParticipants.Creations and redemptions take place at the official net asset value of theETF. Since the NAV of the fund is calculated from the basket of stocks calledthe creation unit and a specified cash adjustment amount, both the basketand the ETF at that price are of equal value. If there were no charges forbalance sheet usage and the positioning of stocks, one should be indifferentas to whether to hold the ETF shares or the creation unit of the ETF andits requisite cash piece. This essentially describes the arbitrage relationshipbetween the separate and distinct pieces. The ETF trades as a security listedon the exchange at prices determined by the supply and demand of themarketplace. The basket of securities making up the creation unit also tradesas listed securities independent of each other and independent of the ETF.However, an arbitrage relationship has been created by the creation andredemption mechanism that enables traders to tie the relationships of thevarious different prices together to an NAV value. This topic is looked at infurther detail in the trading strategies discussion in Chapter .Cl ient Driven Creat ion and Redempt ion Even if the creation or redemptionis based on a client order, the AP is actually deciding to use the creation andredemption process. When I speak with clients who are seeking to moveshares in large size into or out of an ETF, they are always asking if theycan just do a creation or redemption. It would be beneficial if clients movedaway from thinking that they are doing an actual creation or redemptionto the view that someone will be facilitating their access or exit into or outof an ETF via the creation and redemption mechanism. There are severalreasons for this Clients should not feel constrained by the creation unit size. The creation and redemption process delineates basket pricing on theclosing price, while an AP can access intraday liquidity for tailoredexecutions. There are a multitude of execution methods around basketexecution that do not require only ontheclose execution.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACE The creation and redemption process is really a backoffice endofdayfunction utilized to transfer and flatten positions. It gives the AP, however, the ability to provide either liquidity or the underlying exchangeof securities for ETFs to the customer throughout the day.Let us talk about these points in further detail. The client base shouldnot feel constrained by the creation unit size. Creation unit size is typicallya minimum amount of shares that can be submitted by an AP for either acreation or a redemption order. The size minimum was created as a functionof the regulation process that allowed ETF issuers to interact with an institutional client base. The process allows for the APs to aggregate smaller tradesinto a larger lot size and then process a creation to flatten their position.The ETF clients, and the advisor businesses that are handling their orderflow, need to realize that if they contact either an AP desk or a portfoliotrading desk typically these two are either the same or related, the tradingdesk can go out and transact in the underlying ETF basket and give them animplied ETF price execution. If the creation unit size is , shares, thetrading desk still can go out into the underlying market and trade a smallerbasket on the behalf of the client. This is actually what is being done whenthe liquidity providers are making markets in the ETF. They are taking onthe risk of providing an ETF price and will go out and hedge with the basketafter the ETF trade has been completed. This process can also be utilizedin a riskfree fashion, however, via an agency type of order from the client.This order effectively instructs the trading desk to transact in the underlyingbasket first, then calculate the implied ETF price from the basket executionsand give the client an ETF report. If the size that is being facilitated is smallerthan the creation unit size then it will lead to residual shares on the trading desk books. This will lead to a slightly higher facilitation fee to coverfinancing until the ETF desk can piece together an entire creation unit andcollapse the position.The next point to discuss revolves around pricing. Because an ETFreleases a creation basket every day, then any time you trade that exactbasket of stocks, you are trading the ETF at its relative NAV price. If youare benchmarked to the official NAV price for some reason and you wantto be able to compare your price to the published NAV of the ETF, tradingat the close is optimal. The official ETF NAV is based off the closing pricesin the underlying stocks see Chapter , and by trading at those closingprices your price should match the ETF NAV. However, if you trade theexact basket of the ETF one hour before the close, you are also trading atthe implied NAV of the fund, however in this circumstance it is called theETFs intraday indicative value. The creation and redemption process letsthe liquidity providers pursue any arbitrage slippage between the basket andP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeDevelopment of an ETF the ETF price. Pursuing strategies utilizing the underlying basket as yourtrading vehicle can give you executions in your desired ETF without actuallytrading the ETF on the exchange, at prices that are at or very close tothe intraday NAV. An example would be to instruct an AP to buy theunderlying basket of a very illiquid U.S.listed ETF with domestic underlyingconstituents at the volume weighted average price VWAP during the day.The AP would then work orders in all the underlying stocks in the basketand come to an overall VWAP price on the basket, which can then beinterpolated into an ETF price. This is transacting in the ETF while notactually trading it, and is another way to pursue liquidity.TRADING TIPThe volume weighted average price VWAP is a measure of the notional amount of a stock traded divided by the amount of shares tradedover a specified time period. If you are trading at the VWAP price, youare trading where the majority of stock has traded during that sametime period. The VWAP algorithm is used by money managers to ensure that they are buying and selling stocks at prices in line with therest of the market.At that point, the AP would have a position in which it sells the clientthe ETF shares and has bought the basket replicating that ETF. A creationorder would then be submitted to flatten the trading book positions. Letus take a closer look at who this critical player is in facilitating the inkinddelivery of shares leading to the creation and redemption of the ETF.Authorized Part ic ipantThe creation and redemption mechanism that enables the ETF to acceptand disburse assets also functions as a necessary position managementsystem for the facilitators of ETF secondary market trading the Authorized Participants. The mechanism is essentially designed to enable sharedelivery back and forth between the issuer and the street, without the issueractually having to execute baskets.Becoming an AP requires an agreement with the ETF issuer and putsthe AP in a position to consolidate baskets of stocks and deliver them inexchange for shares of the ETF. It also enables the AP to receive those basketsfrom the ETF and disburse them into the market when a redemption orderoccurs. It is probably one of the most crucial aspects of the entire processP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEbecause, without the APs consolidating basket trades into large blocks andthen delivering them, assets would not grow and fees would not be earned.The ultimate goal relies on the partnership between the AP and the issuerand their delivery of baskets of stocks to that issuer. It is this process thatenables an ETF to grow and increase in assets.There is no initial fee to become an AP, and, in fact, it has become avery good business for participants. Almost every major investment bankand clearing firm has become an AP to facilitate the ETF creation andredemption process. There is a fee charged for creating and redeeming ETFs,but it is typically rated as a processing fee. This fee is typically a single flat feeirrespective of how many units are required in the transaction. This createsa great economy of scale benefit to a large client marketmaking business.Because it is unknown how many shares of an ETF an AP will trade in thefuture, the creation and redemption fees are built into the standard spreadsin an ETF market. This creates the situation where APs can build the feespread into every trade they do upon consolidating order flow, they can,over time, reap that differential between one unit and multiple units. If thetrade is an agencytype creation or redemption, the client will pay the fee.If a market is being made, the ETF spread will include the fee on a pershare basis. A byproduct of making markets in ETFs will enable an APto collect creation and redemption fees in market spreads, particularly inlowervolume ETFs. If the volume coming in the future is unknown, marketmakers include in their spread the cost of flattening their books via thecreation and redemption process. If the ETF has a very high volume, thereis a higher chance of unwinding any facilitation position in the market, andspreads can include a probability adjustment to the creation fee, enablingslightly tighter markets. This helps to partially explain why ETF spreadsnarrow as volume increases as products develop.Trading Example of an AP Faci l i tat ing Order F low An AP facilitating multiple clients could produce results in this manner If a client enters an orderto buy , shares of ETFA, the AP acting as a liquidity provider couldsell the client the ETF and buy the creation unit basket of shares to hedge theshort ETF exposure. The creation unit size in ETFA is , shares, andthe fee is , to do a creation or redemption, regardless of the number ofunits. When the client order comes to the trading desk, the AP has no clearidea of what the future will bring in terms of additional orders, so embeddedin the price that the AP offers the shares for ETFA to the client would be thecost per share to process the creation, or  cents per share ,, .. Then, later that day, another client may come in to buy an additional, shares of ETFA. At this point the AP still does not know if futureclient orders will go in the opposite direction and cancel out the position,P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeDevelopment of an ETF so the AP again embeds the creation costs in the asking price, or another cents per share.For this example, we are speaking about an ETF that has low intradayvolume. The AP is hedging with the basket instead of unwinding the ETFposition in the secondary market. At this point the AP has now collected, in creation fees embedded in the spread, but because it pays a flatfee to create units, it will have to pay , only. Let us add a sellerto this concept. A new client comes in with , shares of ETFA tosell. At this point the AP would calculate the price it is willing to pay,including a redemption fee of  cent per share ,,  ..The client trades and sells the ETFA shares, and the AP sells basket sharesunderlying , shares of the ETF. The AP has now completely flattenedits positions in both the ETF and the basket component shares, leaving itwith no balance sheet usage. Additionally, the AP has collected three setsof fees for creation and redemption orders that are not processed versusthe issuer. This highlights the importance to issuers of working diligently tokeep creationredemption costs down to the lowest minimum charge they cannegotiate with processing agents. These costs, which can be considered animplicit cost of trading ETFs, can have a direct impact on the costs of trading.Although the cost is present in every ETF, it is more relevant in ETFs with lowintraday trading volume because typically there are not as many offsettingtrades that work to enable market participants to narrow the spread. Thispoint is discussed in further detail in Chapter  regarding execution.CONCLUSIONThis chapter has covered a lot of ground, much of which will be expanded onlater in the book. We have started with the initial development proceduresof the ETF because that is where the decisions are made regarding theETFs underlying exposures. A solid foundation in the mechanics of ETFdevelopment is beneficial for the proper utilization of the products. Thegrowth of the ETF and its facilitation by the Authorized Participants usingthe creation and redemption mechanism was presented because it is such aprimary advantage of the ETF wrapper.The exchangetraded fund is a very pure product and is the one thatbestows a variety of benefits to the user. Chapter  takes a closer look atthe various structures of exchangetraded products. The listed funds industry has expanded to include products that look similar to ETFs but havesome important differentiating characteristics. It is important to understandthose features when determining which product is right for each investmentopportunity.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeCHAPTER Structure of an ETFT he landscape of listed investment products has become populated witha variety of different structures that often get lumped under the termexchangetraded funds ETFs. The term ETF traditionally refers toan investment company with redeemable shares that trade on an exchange.There are a variety of newer products that offer similar exposure and tradability but are not investment companies or funds. Nonetheless, manypeople lump these products together with traditional ETFs. This can beconfusing to investors because of the various different structural qualitiesthat many of these products possess. Because these products can have verydifferent tax treatment and risk profiles, this confusion can have significantnegative consequences for investors. Many articles have been written bysome of the best minds in the industry decrying the confusion created byboth the media and sometimes even industry participants. The main focus ofthis book is on the largest group of products by assets within the exchangelisted product universe, exchangetraded funds. It would be remiss, however,to ignore the different types of structures available in the marketplace or tolump them all under the ETF moniker. This chapter delineates the differentstructures available and their identifying properties. It then discusses someof the consequences of the varying structures with regard to trading, taxes,and other advantages and disadvantages.There are opportunities to use all of the different structures profitablyin an investment portfolio. This chapter does not make any determinationas to which vehicle is right for your portfolio or is the best vehicle to use.Understanding the differences will enable you to make the appropriate decisions regarding use and positioning within each unique portfolio. Muchmore could be written about the various structures and their particular nuances. This chapter is meant as a broad overview of what is available in themarketplace to enable you to identify the various structures and their maincharacteristics.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEWhat is important to realize going forward is that, now more than ever,structure matters. When exchangelisted products were in their infancy, therewas not much choice in what product type to use with regard to a specificexposure. As the industry has matured, there are now similar exposuresavailable in different product structures. Each structure has a different effecton the portfolio in which it is utilized. Product development teams are focusing new products on investment categories where they can compete witha better structure for investment assets. There have been many reports overthe last several years about products not providing their expected exposures,whether they were leveraged, futuresbased, or some other type of product.Many times it is not the product acting improperly, but the user base makingincorrect assumptions due to inadequate knowledge about how the variousstructures will react under differing circumstances. Understanding the various structures, how they achieve their exposures, and how they will reactunder particular market circumstances will go a long way toward enablingyou to utilize them for a profitable investment strategy. The informationprovided is meant as a guide and should not be utilized as investment adviceor tax guidance. Any decisions you make regarding tax consequences orstructure should be discussed with your accountants and attorneys.CATEGORIZ ING EXCHANGETRADED PRODUCTSThere are now a lot of different product structures that people refer to asETFs but that do not meet the definition of a traditional ETF. It is importantto distinguish between the four main product categories and what productsshould be included in each. Without a standard convention, the public,the media, and even issuers sometimes blur the lines between the producttypes and create unnecessary confusion. It would be helpful for everyone toutilize the same naming conventions so that the investing public can easilyidentify the various product types. The New York Stock Exchange NYSEuses some baseline definitions that make sense for classifying products. Thedefinitions areExchangetraded product ETP The term for the overriding productcategory. This includes funds, indexlinked notes, limited partnerships LPs, and trusts listed and traded in the secondary market onexchanges.The common characteristics are Issuers do not sell shares directly to investors. They issue sharesto Authorized Participants APs in large blocks typically ,shares or more that are known as creation units.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeStructure of an ETF  Those creation units are not purchased with cash. Instead, a basket of specified securities is exchanged for ETF shares utilizing aninkind exchange mechanism. This leads to advantages in taxesand portfolio management. This also includes some funds andnotes that are cashcreateandredeem vehicles. The shares of the ETP are traded throughout the day on a publicexchange. Market liquidity is provided in many ETPs by market makerswho utilize the creation and redemption features to exchangeunderlying baskets for ETP shares.Exchangetraded fund ETF What most people think of as ETFs.The most widely used product in the category. Similar to mutualfunds in that they offer public investors an undivided interest in apool of securities and other assets, but shares can be bought andsold like stocks on an exchange through a brokerdealer. ETFs haveseveral distinguishing characteristics The portfolio is managed by an investment advisor with a mandate to track the index or portfolio benchmark. ETFs may beactively managed or index based. If it is index based, the portfolio manager has discretion on the way to track the index e.g., fullreplication versus sampling of the index. The structure permitsmanagement of cash inside the fund e.g., reinvestment of dividend income, taxloss harvesting, securities lending, and someother items. ETFs are registered under the Investment Company Act of ,which provides investors with certain regulatory protections. Like traditional mutual funds, they generally have an independentboard of trustees that has oversight over the fund. There are,however, unit investment trusts UITs, such as the SPDR SP ETF, that do not have a board.Exchangetraded note ETN A debt security issued by an underwritingbank to track the return of a specific underlying benchmark. Thedebt is typically senior, unsecured, and unsubordinated. ETNs havea maturity date like most other debt securities. The main identifyingcharacteristic is that an ETN is backed only by the credit of theissuer. The ETN is also subject to specific tax treatment discussedlater in the chapter.Exchangetraded vehicle ETV This term is not as widely utilized asETF and ETN. Many of the products in this category are alsosometimes called broadly ETPs, which is correct but does not helpin distinguishing them from the ETF and ETN structures.

Although itmakes sense to refer to all listed funds as ETPs, that product delineation caninclude closedend funds as well, and some providers have been using thatETP as well as ETF for those products for many years. This blurring of thelines makes products more difficult for the investing public to understand.ETF REGULATIONETFs are regulated by multiple divisions of the Securities and ExchangeCommission SEC. The SEC Division of Investment Management regulatesthe fund aspect of the ETF. In parallel, the SEC Division of Trading andMarkets regulates the exchange traded aspect of the ETF. Both of thesedivisions require ETFs to comply with certain rules. The U.S. CommodityFutures Trading Commission CFTC also regulates certain ETPs that holdcommodities the Division of Investment management does not have jurisdiction over these types of products. The CFTC does not have any regulatoryoversight over ETFs or ETNs it regulates only those ETPs that operate ascommodity pools. ETVs and ETNs file a registration statement with theSECs Division of Corporation Finance.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeStructure of an ETF The Division of Investment Management IM regulates all investmentcompanies such as mutual funds, closedend funds, UITs, ETFs, and interval funds, including variable insurance products and federally registeredinvestment advisors. ETF sponsors typically are also registered investmentadvisors. Therefore, they are required to interact with the Division of Investment Management on two levels at the ETF level and as a registeredinvestment advisor.Because ETFs do not fit neatly into the regulations governing mutualfunds and closedend funds, ETF sponsors are required to obtain exemptive relief from the Investment Company Act of  to operate an ETF.In order to obtain this relief from the  Act, sponsors submit a detailedapplication with the SEC. The exemptive relief usually covers a broad spectrum of products e.g., equities, fixed income and is a requirement before asponsor can launch its first product. The SEC approved the first indexbasedETF in  but did not approve the first actively managed ETF until .Exempt ive Rel ie fETFs are launched under the provisions of the Investment Company Actof . Because ETFs operate in a manner not contemplated by the Act, ETFs need exemptions from that act to operate. Doing this typicallyis referred to as exemptive relief. Having exemptive relief enables ETFissuers to bring products to market under their specific exemptions. A sponsor cannot operate an ETF without exemptive relief. Applying for such reliefcan take several months or even years, and may cost a tremendous amountof money in legal bills and other requirements.Here are some of the typical exemptions that the product issuersapply for They need to be enabled to issue shares redeemable only in large blockscalled creation units. [Sections a  a] They seek the permission for the inkind purchase and redemption ofcreation units with the ETF by APs. [Sections a] They want an exemption for other investment companies to be ableto purchase shares of the funds in excess of the acts fund of fundregulations. [Section d]The growth of the ETF business created a large increase in requestsfor very similar exemptions by the various ETF issuers. In , the SECannounced a proposal for Rule c. The rule would provide several exemptions from the Investment Company Act to permit ETFs to form andoperate without the need to obtain individual exemptive relief from the SEC.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEIt would codify most of the exemptions previously granted by the SEC toindexbased ETFs and, pursuant to several recently issued exemption orders,to fully transparent, actively managed ETFs. The proposed rule has not yetbeen adopted by the SEC.Each ETF is required to file a prospectus similar to traditional mutualfund pursuant to Registration Statement Form NA. This regulatory filingcontains the fund prospectus and statement of additional information SAI.SEC Div is ion of Trading and MarketsThe SEC Division of Trading and Markets, known as the Division of MarketRegulation until November , regulates all the major stock exchangesin the United States. There are currently  securities exchanges registeredwith the SEC under Section a of the Securities Exchange Act of and subject to oversight by the SEC including the NYSE, Nasdaq, and otherregional and electronic exchanges.The Division of Trading and Markets oversight includes the exchangelisting rules for all securities, including ETFs. A generic listing standardfor domestic equity ETFs was adopted in the early s. The internationalequity and others followed in  and thereafter. The generic standardsubstantially sped up the time to market for new ETF listings. As long asthe sponsor had its exemptive relief and the product met the genericlisting standard, the ETF could be listed once the prospectus was declaredeffective.Requirements for L ist ing ProductsExchange listing rules spell out a lengthy list of requirements for ETF sponsors, including minimum shares outstanding and index calculation rules.The stock exchanges require a minimum of , shares to be outstanding at commencement of trading, but there is no specific notional dollaramount or minimum share price.

ETFs can be utilized for cash management and employedduring transitions or other times, for easily accessing sometimes hardtoachieve exposures, and for other institutional portfolio management needs.However, Section d of the Investment Company Act limits the ability of an investment company or a portfolio that would be an investmentcompany but for a specific exemption from the  Act. In order toenable use by mutual funds and funds that would be registered investmentcompanies but have a specific exemption, the ETF issuers had to obtainrelief from Section d of the Investment Company Act of . Thissection restricts the ability of an investment company to invest in another.The section reads. A. It shall be unlawful for any registered investment company theacquiring company and any company or companies controlled bysuch acquiring company to purchase or otherwise acquire any securityissued by any other investment company the acquired company, andfor any investment company the acquiring company and any company or companies controlled by such acquiring company to purchaseor otherwise acquire any security issued by any registered investmentcompany the acquired company, if the acquiring company and anycompany or companies controlled by it immediately after such purchaseor acquisition own in the aggregatei.

This exemption enabledmutual funds to hold substantially larger positions than those dictated bythe rule. Approximately one year later, the large trusts SPDR SP  ETFSPY, Diamonds Trust DIA, and SP Midcap Depository Receipt MDYreceived similar exemptions. Today, most ETFs have received exemptionfrom the restrictions in Section d. It is up to individual issuers to eachP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEobtain this exemption to enable larger holdings by mutual funds. Then it isup to each institutional investor to sign an agreement with the issuer so thatit can achieve its desired position sizes in the ETFs.EXCHANGETRADED NOTESExchangetraded notes are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities registered under the Securities Act of . ETNs are designed to provide investors with exposure to the return of an index or specific investmentstrategy after fees. These notes are issued by a bank or specialty finance company the shares are listed on a stock exchange. Like equities, ETNs tradeon an exchange and can be shorted. Like an index fund, they are linkedto the return of a benchmark index and provide investors with convenientexposure to the returns of market benchmarks, less investor fees. The ETNstructure allows investors to gain exposure to difficulttoreach market sectors or strategies due to regulatory constraints on other types of structures.ETNs also have different tax implications from other ETPs that certaininvestors may find attractive. However this tax treatment is uncertain.ETNs convey no ownership or assets, just a promise from the issuer thatthe return of the benchmark index net of fees will be paid upon redemptionor maturity. The value of the note is determined by the total return of theindex it tracks and by the creditworthiness of the issuer. ETNs are not ETFs,equities, or index mutual funds, but they share some similarities in providingexposure to end investors via a listed equitytype security.They do, however, have some risks that can be similar or go beyond therisks of traditional ETFs Principal is not protected, and you may lose all of your investment inthe securities if the issuer declares bankruptcy. The index sponsor may adjust the index in a way that affects its level,and the index sponsor has no obligation to consider your interests. There may not be an active trading market in the securities liquidity ofthe market for the ETN shares may vary materially over time. ETNs are debt securities and have no voting rights, since the investorowns a debt instrument, not the underlying security. Individual ETNs are not rated but generally rely on the ratings of theissuer. Changes in the issuers creditworthiness may have a significanteffect on the value of the exchangetraded price of the ETN. Most ETNs contain a call feature that allows the issuer to repurchasethe notes at its option, which may result in the principal repaymentbeing earlier than anticipated.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeStructure of an ETF  ETNs are debt securities issued by a bank and are not regulated byCFTC. However, if ETNs hold futures contracts on the underlyingrelevant market index, those contracts may be regulated by the CFTCand may restrict the ability for the bank to access those markets. Thiscould cause a disruption in access to the ETN shares. ETNs are not registered under the Investment Company Act of .The concept of indexlinked notes and similar types of structured products has existed on Wall Street for decades. The ability to list notes on thestock exchange in the form of ETNs provided banks the opportunity to capitalize on the popularity of ETFs, albeit in a different structure. In the middleof , Barclays Bank listed the first exchangebased products utilizing theETN structure. The initial issuance was driven by  the assertions on favorable tax treatment relative to other exchangetraded products  accessto strategies and asset classes that were not available in the traditional ETFstructure registered under the  Act and  issuers could bring the products to market very quickly as compared to the more traditional structuresthat needed review by the SECs Division of Investment Management. Theonly practical limitation, from an ETN sponsors point of view, is the abilityand desire of the issuer to offer a specific investment strategy. The structuralfeatures of ETNs as debt instruments have driven some innovation in theETF spacespecifically in the hardtoaccess asset categories such as commodities, alternative strategies, and volatility. A list of key participants inan ETN offering follows. Platform This is the sponsor of the ETN products. Platforms can beopen architecture e.g., The Elements Group of products that offer avariety of thirdparty indexes or a closed architecture e.g., UBS thatonly offer proprietary index strategies. Index providers The role of the index provider is to calculate, maintain,and publish the necessary information on the index benchmark. Theindex provider is usually a third party. Issuers The ETNs are senior unsecured obligations of investmentgradeissuers. Distributors The distributor is responsible for the marketing and promotion for the ETN. The distributor generally receives a fee based onassets under management. The ETN often carries the brand name of thedistributor, but this is not a requirement. Stock exchanges The listing venues for the ETNs that require the indexes and notes to follow certain rules in order to gain approval forlisting.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACETAXATIONETF Tax Benef i tsThe tax benefits of the ETF structure are a key feature that sets it apartfrom other competing products. Most ETFs are considered extremely taxefficient as compared to traditional mutual funds. Funds registered underthe Investment Company Act of , which include mutual funds andETFs, are required to distribute capital gains to shareholders on an annualbasis, in addition to any income e.g., dividends. Capital gains are generatedinside a portfolio when the portfolio manager buys, and consequently sells,securities. Portfolio managers sell stocks to raise cash to meet shareholderredemptions or due to a reallocation of assets. Mutual fund shareholdersmay receive capital gains from a mutual fund, even if they have not sold theirshares andor have an unrealized loss on their position. Index mutual fundstend to be more tax efficient than actively managed mutual funds simplybecause the turnover in the portfolio tends to be lower on average hencethere are less frequent buyssells at the portfolio level. Portfolio managerscan take advantage of capital loss carry forwards from prior fiscal years, taxloss harvesting, and other tax mitigation strategies to diminish the impactof trading. Investors ultimately control the decision of when to sell ETFshares and how to calculate the applicable taxes on any resulting capitalgainloss.The main characteristics of the tax advantages for ETFs are listed next. Investors buy and sell the ETFs in the secondary market. This enablesmuch of the daily flow of ETFs to be offset against each other awayfrom the ETF portfolio. The ETF Portfolio Manager is then able to tradeless frequently and to create fewer taxable events within the portfolio.Additionally some of the trading and execution expenses are passeddown to the individual investor level rather than having all investorspick up the fees for each individuals movements in and out of a fund. The ETF creation and redemption mechanism utilizes an inkind exchange of the underlying basket for the shares of the ETF. When a mutual fund receives share creations or redemptions, the portfolio managerhas to buy and sell shares of the underlying stocks. When an ETF hasshare creations or redemptions, the portfolio delivers or receives the required underlying basket of securities without creating taxable events,trading expenses, or portfolio slippage. By executing portfolio rebalances and other eventdriven e.g., corporate actions portfolio trades, ETF managers can manage any otherP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeStructure of an ETF tax consequences that might not have been eliminated by the inkindprocedures. Many ETFs are indextracking funds that exhibit very low portfolioturnover as compared to actively managed funds.The creation and redemption process gives the ETF structure a taxable advantage compared to many other pooled and structured investmentsavailable in the market. Because standard creations are done where the ETFreceives in stock and redemptions are where the ETF delivers out stock via aninkind transaction, the portfolio manager is able to manage the gains withinthe ETF basket efficiently. During the redemption process, the ETF managercan choose to deliver lowcost stock from an accounting perspective, clearing the balance sheet of potential gains. It is very rare for an indexbasedETF to pay out a capital gain when it does occur, it is usually dictated bysome special, unforeseen circumstance.The general tax treatment for ETFs is like that of stocks and mutualfunds. Any capital gains or dividend income are treated similarly. ETFsoffer investors the ability to hold positions for longer than one year forlongterm holding treatment. And they offer the ability to move betweendifferent but somewhat similar market exposures. This potentially enablesinvestors to maintain similar exposure to an asset category without violatingwashsale regulations.It is important to note that the tax treatments and related implications for investors may be significantly different for certain international stockbond ETFs, leverageinverse ETFs, currencylinked ETPs, andcommoditylinked ETPs.Certain international ETFs, specifically with exposure to the emergingmarkets, have the potential to be less tax efficient than domestic and developed market ETFs. Many emerging markets have restrictions on the abilityto perform inkind deliveries of securities. Therefore, an emergingmarketETF may have to sell securities to raise cash for redemptions instead ofdelivering stock. Lack of inkind delivery gives emergingmarket ETFs oneless weapon to mitigate tax liability, but all of the other features apply.History has shown that capital gains in these funds have been minimal tononexistent.Leveragedinverse ETFs have proven to be relatively taxinefficient vehicles. Many of the funds have had significant capital gain distributionsonboth the long and the short funds. These funds generally use derivatives,specifically swaps and futures, to gain exposure to the index. Derivativescannot be delivered in kind and must be bought or sold. Gains fromthese derivatives generally receive  treatment by the Internal RevenueP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEService IRS, which means that  are considered longterm gains and are considered shortterm gains regardless of the contracts holding period. Historically, flows in these products have been volatile, and the dailyrepositioning of the portfolio in order to achieve daily index tracking triggerssignificant potential tax consequences for these funds.Commodity ETPs have a similar tax treatment to leverageinverse ETFsdue to the use of derivatives and the  tax treatment. However, commodity ETPs do not have the daily index tracking requirement, use leverageshort strategies, and have less volatile cash flows simply due to thenature of the funds. Commodity ETPs typically are given a Schedule K fortax purposes. There are some further details about funds holding physicalcommodities in Chapter .ETN Tax TreatmentThe potentially favorable tax treatment of ETNs has been a major aspectof their popularity since the first notes were launched in June . Issuershave made the argument, supported by their tax counsels, that ETNs shouldreceive similar tax treatment to indexlinked structured products. This taxtreatment puts the notes at an advantage compared with openend mutualfunds and traditional ETFs. The Internal Revenue Service is questioningthis tax treatment. Investors using these products should carefully considerpotential tax issues and their possible tax liability.U.S. tax consequences for ETN investments are uncertain. On December, , the IRS and the Treasury Department issued Notice , stating that they are considering issuing new regulations or other guidance onthe products. The notice indicated the IRS and Treasury Department wereconsidering whether investors should be required to accrue income and expenses during the term of the ETN. Without firm guidance, the currentpractice for ETN tax treatment as put forth by ETN sponsors is that equityand commoditylinked ETNs generally are treated as prepaid forward contracts for tax purposes. Investors recognize a gain or loss upon the sale,redemption, or maturity of the ETN in an amount equal to the differencebetween the amount of the proceeds and the cost basis in the securities. If thistax treatment is respected, equity and commoditylinked ETNs should notbe treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and investors shouldnot recognize taxable income due to interest inclusions or original issue discount during the holding period of these ETNs. Therefore, under this treatment, investors only recognize a capital gain or loss upon the sale, maturity,or repurchase by the issuer of their Equity and commoditylinked ETNs.Some market participants believe that the IRS may be concerned thatETNs could become a significant tax shelter. It might be difficult to changeP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeStructure of an ETF the tax treatment of ETNs while preserving the tax treatment for otherstructured products. The major risk to investors is that the IRS would requireETN holders to accrue interest over the term of the ETN even thoughinvestors may not receive any payments with respect to the security untilmaturity. In a worstcase, but relatively unlikely scenario for investors, theIRS could apply this test retroactively.CurrencyL inked ETN Tax Treatment The IRS has ruled that currencylinked ETNs are to be treated as foreigncurrency debt instruments forfederal income tax purposes. Investors are required to include the couponpayments in their annual tax return as ordinary income at the time suchcoupon payments are accrued or received by such holders. This is true ifinvestors do not receive any payments until maturity. Gains or losses recognized in connection with the sale, maturity, or repurchase by the issuer ofthese currencylinked ETNs generally will be treated as ordinary income orloss to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates.Other Tax ConsequencesThe holders of most ETVs not registered under the Investment CompanyAct of  are subject to taxation as a partnership. As a result, they willreceive a Schedule K tax form. Whether these ETVs are held for one dayor the whole year, investors still receive a K reflecting their prorated shareof the gains, losses, income, and deductions.The grantor trust products investing in nonU.S. currencies are taxed atordinary income rates. There will be no distributed realized capital gains andno interest income. When investors are positioning the funds with holdings inactual underlying precious metals, there is a potential tax liability applicableto collectibles. Under current law, gains recognized by individuals from thesale of collectibles, such as gold and silver bullion, held for more thanone year are taxed at a maximum rate of , rather than the  rateapplicable to most other longterm capital gains.With the diversity of product structures, investors need to consider aminefield of potential tax consequences. This book does not offer any taxadvice, and any comments regarding the way certain products are taxed maybe different, depending on your personal tax situation.WHEN STRUCTURAL ISSUES ARISEThere can be problems with various structures that may not have beenexpected when the product was initially launched. For example, some     FFOORR  SSAALLEE    EEXXCCHHAANNGGEE            wwwwww..ttrraaddiinnggssooffttwwaarreeccoolllleeccttiioonn..ccoomm             MMiirrrroorrss    wwwwww..ffoorreexxwwaarreezz..ccoomm   wwwwww..ttrraaddeerrssssooffttwwaarree..ccoomm wwwwww..ttrraaddiinnggssooffttwwaarreeddoowwnnllooaadd..ccoomm        JJooiinn  MMyy  MMaaiilliinngg  LLiisstt    P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEproducts have been temporarily unable to issue new shares or even havebeen liquidated due to issues with underlying investments.Credit R isk of an ETNOne of the most significant characteristics of the ETN structure is the creditrisk embedded in the product. In ordinary times, this credit risk was treatedwith skepticism because the ETN issuers were historically large and stablefinancial institutions. The financial crisis that began in  proved thateven the most unexpected events can occur and that risk in general wasmispriced in the markets and particularly with regard to the Lehman Optaseries of ETNs.In the ETN structure, there are not any specific assets underlying thenote. You have a promise from the underwriting bank to pay a stated rate,like an exchangelisted swap. When Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy,holders of its Opta ETNs were completely exposed. Now they are in linewith other creditors to see what remains of the firms assets. Although ETNproducts may appear preferable to their competitors for investors who arelooking to potentially minimize taxable income, the risk of issuer default issomething that should certainly be taken into consideration.Discounts and Premiums fromIssuance Restr ict ionsRestricted market access has also taken its toll on the ETN market in recentyears. The iPath MSCI India ETN INP, which is linked to the iPath MSCIIndia Total Return Index, ran into difficulties in issuing shares in late .At that time, the Securities Exchange Board of India SEBI implementedrestrictions with respect to derivative instruments linked to Indian equitysecurities. The iPath MSCI India ETN was accessing the Indian equitiesmarket through overthecounter derivatives. When SEBI restricted access,the iPath ETN lost its ability to create new shares. When an openendedproduct loses its ability to issue new shares, it begins to act like a closedend fund. It loses the connection between the price of the underlying assetsand the price of the ETN. When a product is no longer able to issue newshares, the price of the ETN should move to a premium to net asset value.This would be the result of less liquidity providers willing to sell the ETNshares and buy the underlying pursuing the typical arbitrage available between those assets. If the trader cannot create shares, being short the ETNand long the underlying basket would leave it with a perpetual up and downposition that cannot be collapsed using the creation mechanism. As you cansee in Exhibit ., when INP halted creations in late , the premiumP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeStructure of an ETF EXHIB IT . INP DiscountPremium ChartSource Bloomberg.on the fund spiked for an extended time period. This is just one exampleof what can happen when the arbitrage mechanism is interrupted by someevent. When the fund was later able to issue new shares the large premiumdisappeared.Both of the problems just mentioned are not necessarily problems in thestructure of ETFs as much as potential issues that can arise by using ETNsas an investment vehicle. Problems like this do not occur when the ETFstructure is used with a basket of securities that is representative of the fundsunderlying assets. As I write this, the ETVs providing commodities exposureare undergoing some problems with new share issuance and growth. I discussthose issues in more detail in Chapter .CONCLUSIONThere is clearly confusion in the marketplace about the differences betweenall of the available products and their structural characteristics. I have triedto highlight some of the most important things to be aware of when makingP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEinvestment decisions. As the industry expands and exposures in varying typesof structures begin to be replicated, it will become much more important tounderstand the different characteristics.The currency funds are an interesting category. There are products withsimilar exposure in differing structures. It remains to be seen how investorswill migrate as performance track records evolve. What is certain is thatstructure is important and can be critical to your portfolio returns.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeCHAPTER Bringing an ETF to the MarketA s with most things in life, there are upsides and downsides to bringingan exchangetraded fund ETF to market. For many ETFs, the exchangelisting has facilitated their growth. The listing enables investors to utilize theunique benefit of the intraday trading ability of an openended wrapper. Itprovides investors with the flexibility to take advantage of intraday volatility,as compared to other products that might offer only endofday liquidity.For certain types of ETFs, however, being listed on the exchange has led toconfusion.One of the most confusing issues concerns ETF trading volumes. AsETFs move further along the evolutionary path from index replication toolsand hedging products toward investment vehicles, different parts of theirstructure become more valuable. Trading volume is one of the statisticsthat sometimes breeds confusion. Because some ETFs have high intradaytrading volumes, it is sometimes assumed that the higher the volume, themore useful the ETF. That assumption does not take into account the variety of offerings of the ETF marketplace. Many of the newer productsthat have been issued are investment products. They compete with mutualfund or hedge fundstyle investments. While the intraday trading featureis important for a highfrequency trading vehicle, daily trading volume isless important for an investment vehicle. What is important is the ability to utilize the underlying basket to reduce execution impact to get inand out of a fund, which is made possible by the creation and redemptionmechanism.The ideal situation for ETFs is when liquidity providers stand as intermediaries between customers and the underlying baskets via the ETF. If theETF structure is working, a customer can get into or out of an ETF withminimal impact on the ETF on the exchange. The largest U.S. ETF exchange,The New York Stock Exchange NYSE Arca, tries to help facilitate this activity by having a lead market maker LMM in almost every product. TheLMM is an important player in bringing new ETFs to the market. In thisP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEchapter we look closely at the LMM, at the seeding of new products andother processes related to the incubation of ETFs.This chapter focuses on seeding ETFs because it is a critical part of theprocess in bringing an ETF from concept to listed product. We discuss incubation as it relates to helping ETFs grow and the deluge of new productscoming to market. The chapter closes with a brief discussion about marketing because it can make or break many products and is often overlooked byboth clients and newer issuers.PARTNERING WITH AN EXCHANGEETFs, as the e in the name implies, are listed on an exchange but may tradeon multiple exchanges and ECNs. Exchanges currently charge a listing feeand provide a list of services to ETF issuers that choose to list on them. Listing has taken a followtheherd mentality whereby the NYSE Arca controlsmore than  of the ETF listings in the United States. For the majority ofinvestors, beyond highfrequency and other highly technical trading firms,electronic trading has in many ways diluted the personal value offered bya specific exchange. For example, in many cases, when I trade in my electronic account, I do not even know which exchange my order went to forprocessing. When I worked as a trader at Bear Stearns, we used to see orderflow that specifically dictated the exchange where it should be traded. Smartorder routers and best execution regulations, however, have diminished thevalue of any specific exchange in favor of clients getting fair pricing wherevertheir order flow is routed.The exchanges act as the intermediary between the ETF issuer and the investing world, as the mechanism for the ETFs secondary distribution. Mostnew ETFs need incubation periods during which the products recruit marketparticipants, assets, and interest. There are always exceptions, such as thethreetimesleveraged ETFs that launched into a market sweet spot in late. In several of these funds, both volumes and assets grew very quicklywithout an introductory phase. The first ETF to be listed, howeverthe SPYin did not pick up a large amount of assets and volumes until threeor four years after its initial launch. Exchanges have an opportunity to stepforward to help issuers and investors by providing for product incubationneeds that would create further investor interest and help to attract assets.This would add real value to issuers as well as to the investing community.LEAD MARKET MAKERThere are no more specialists in the ETF world with the move of primarylistings to the NYSE Arca platform, they are now called lead market makersP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeBringing an ETF to the Market LMMs. One of the most profound differences between an LMM and aspecialist is that there is no longer a time and place advantage. Being anLMM is essentially committing to provide electronic liquidity in an ETFwith no more information than the rest of the market. In exchange forsatisfying the requirements of the program, there is a small additional rebatein each particular product for which you are the registered LMM.LMMs typically have the opportunity to make money in several wayswhen facilitating flow in the ETF marketplace. They can make money bytraditional market making, that is, by buying on the bid and selling onthe ask side, by arbitrage between the ETF and its underlying basket, andby receiving stock loan fees on inventory and rebates for trading as theLMM. The ability to provide liquidity and hedge via an arbitrage mechanismhas enabled the provision of larger amounts of liquidity with lower risk,leaving the liquidity provider with only a small financing position most ofthe time. ETF arbitrage in this scenario is the spread between where an LMMcan provide liquidity in the ETF and the price at which it can position itshedge. Chapter  presents an indepth discussion on ETF arbitrage here Iintroduce a concept that is prevalent throughout the book ETFs are differentfrom and trade differently from stocks. The differences create more sourcesof liquidity for an ETF than is available in a traditional singlestock equity.A common example is IBM. When a market makerspecialistLMMprovides liquidity in IBM, either by publicly quoting or by taking the otherside of large order flow, there are not many direct ways to hedge or offsetthe position. If the LMM has just sold , shares of IBM to a customer,it can buy another company that it thinks correlates well to IBM and hopeits price will move in tandem with IBMs until the LMM can unwind thepositions. Or it can potentially purchase an offsetting derivative position.But both of these options leave the liquidity provider with a position thathas to be monitored and takes up balance sheet. With an ETF, however,particularly one in which the basket is trading while the ETF is trading,you have an arbitrage trading functionality. You can sell as much of theETF as liquidity is provided by buying the exact underlying basket. Thetwo separate pieces will move in tandem thus you have neutralized yourmarket exposure. This is a significantly different risk from what traditionallyis taken to provide liquidity in the singlestock world of equities.One of the underlying themes in all of the methods that an LMM canundertake to make money in an ETF is that they are all tied to the numberof shares that trade in an ETF. Even their fee structure, which works asa rebate on trading payments, is based on how frequently an ETF trades.This type of system has been very good for the growth of the exchangesbecause it aligns the goals of the exchange with the goals of its contractualmarket makers. What would also be helpful in the LMM model, however,is a special system designed to provide enhanced liquidity in the newer ETFP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEproducts that do not have high trading volumes. This is where a system ofnew product incubation becomes critical.Let us take a look at the requirements of the LMM system. The LMM isa contracted liquidity provider of the exchange. The most basic requirementsof being an LMM are laid out by the NYSE in this way LMMs must maintain continuous, twosided Q orders a market makerquote for each security in which the firm is registered. LMMs must meet minimum performance requirements, which includethe percent of time at the National Best Bid and Offer, average displayedsize, and average quoted spread. Performance requirements will be determined by NYSE Arca.In order to satisfy the demands of having an LMM in each of severalthousand listed products, the requirements are reasonably generic. However,the ETF product line is unique to the exchange system, and its growth hassurprised even some of the most astute market watchers. Let us examinesome of the needs and procedures within a potential ETF incubation system.ETF INCUBATIONETF incubation consists of seeding initial investment and providing initialliquidity and marketing to create an investor comfort level with a newand sometimes complicated structure. An ETF incubation system wouldenable investors to develop an understanding and a sense of security in anew structure that could lead to even greater, widespread adoption of theproduct wrapper. Seeding is the first creation unit needed by an ETF to liston an exchange. There should be a standardized system of seeding new ETFsso that investors are not misled by big seed numbers versus small ones. Theamount of seed capital an ETF begins with is, in essence, a financing tradeheld by the seeder. It is not necessarily an accurate representation of actualinterest in the ETF.During the incubation phase, liquidity providers need to be set up toattract initial real investments. Investors want enough liquidity so that theycan trade the ETFs with minimal impact and at prices closely related to thevalue of the underlying securities. Independent trading firms and liquidityproviders as a unit are willing to provide liquidity through the underlyingbasket or other respective hedges if they can collect small spreads. An entire subindustry of trading firms participates without being paid directlybecause of the arbitrage opportunity inherent in the ETF structure. If anETF is new and unique, however, it will not necessarily attract a widespreaduser base quickly. Even though liquidity can be organically created, thereP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeBringing an ETF to the Market are still relatively few liquidity providers compared to the number of available ETFs. It is not economically viable, nor is there a coordinated effort, to cover every new ETF or lowvolume product that needs additionalliquidity assistance. This fact demonstrates the overwhelming need for anLMM during the incubation phase and perhaps a standardized method ofgreater participation to help newer ETFs get established. It has been statistically proven that the percent of trading volume of an LMM in an ETFmoves in an inversely correlated manner to the trading volume of an ETF.In fact, there has been discussion in the marketplace about removing theLMM completely in some of the most liquid ETFs. This fact demonstratesthe need to find a way to structure the LMM functionality to be utilizedprimarily to provide liquidity where it is most needed in the new and lowervolume ETFs.Lets use a very basic ETF as an example of what can potentially bedone to provide liquidity for the investor base. If you are providing liquidityin a plain vanilla domestic ETF where the basket is reasonably easy toborrow, such as a Standard  Poors  basket, then there could be tightrequirements for a minimum size, depth, and electronic trading ability forthe LMM. This can be a function of the cost to hedge the ETF trade, based onthe trading of the underlying creation basket. In highvolume ETFs, wherecompetition drives prices to levels in which the spreads sometimes actuallyare tighter than the spread of the actual basket, LMM requirements can berelaxed and put into play only during periods of extraordinary duress. If theETF and its basket are trading together in real time, then facilitating liquidityin one from the other is merely a function of applying advanced computingand can be provided in all ETFs equally. There is a cost for borrowingthe underlying stock, and there is a calculation of the execution costs ofthe basket in relation to the size traded or the depth of the market beingprovided. The market width and depth would shift progressively wider andsmaller, respectively, as the difficulty to hedge increases.There also needs to be a marketing effort that introduces the new ETFnot only to the investing public but also to the liquidity providers. Sometimes the structures and their creation and redemption process can get complicated. The processes and risks need to be clearly detailed and explained.The institutions maintaining positions and hedges in these products needto be able to quantify all the risks so they can be properly hedged. Themore comprehensive the hedge, the less risky the position is for the liquidity provider and thus the smaller the spread will be for investors. Investorsneed to understand all the facets of this new ETF to be able to judge theappropriateness of the products as well as predict their potential portfolio performance. All of this work is currently a function of the ETF issuerbut could be achieved more efficiently as a function of an ETF incubationprogram. After achieving an investor comfort level, the issuer will be inP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEa position to attract the maximum potential assets as defined by demand.ETF incubation helps in the period of introduction and establishment of thenewer products.Seeding ETFsThe initial seed of an ETF is commonly misunderstood except by those involved in the process from the very beginning. In order for an ETF to launchon an exchange, it normally needs to have one creation unit outstanding,referred to as the seed unit. In the beginning, specialists wanted to be inETFs because they would make revenues from wide spreads and the rebatethus, they were interested in attaining as many ETF listings as they could.When there were not a lot of ETFs, and the vast majority of those listed werebeginning to trade at reasonable volumes, the specialists were an open faucetof seed capital. This was a great situation for the ETF issuers They had aready market of people willing to put seed capital into their funds to helpthem launch. The growth of the ETF product lineup is partly attributableto the fact that seed capital was once very plentiful for the issuance of newproducts. The use of balance sheet to seed ETFs was extremely inexpensivebefore the downturn of late .Lets look at the positions behind an initial creation unit, which is whatI call the seed of an ETF. In the example, ETFX is a plain vanilla U.S.domesticbased ETF. It is new to the market and needs a seeder to do aninitial creation. In a typical ETF creation order, the Authorized ParticipantAP has to buy the basket of stocks underlying the ETF and deliver those tothe issuer. The ETF issuer will then utilize the continuous issuance functionto deliver new ETF shares to the AP, creating an increase in shares outstanding. In the initial creation unit, the process is exactly the same An AP woulddeliver the shares to the issuer and the issuer would issue new shares ofthe ETF. Once the ETF has shares outstanding or assets under managementAUM, it can be listed on the exchange. These processes are coordinated sothey can happen together.An ordinary creation order typically is dictated by some position thatwas entered into by the AP. Perhaps the AP has sold shares of an ETFand bought the underlying basket, or has entered into some other tradeinvolving the ETF. The seeder of an ETF does not, however, have to takea directional view of the ETF to provide the initial creation unit. Seedersand liquidity providers leave the business of determining market directionto the money managers, hedge funds, and various other clients. Seeders arefinanciers. They are looking to utilize their balance sheet for some form ofremuneration. The LMM seeding model was predicated on the use of balancesheets in exchange for LMM designation that theoretically resulted in profits.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeBringing an ETF to the Market To this end, instead of buying the basket to deliver to the issuer, seedersborrow it. Then they deliver to the issuer the basket of stocks that thenbecome short positions on the seeders books. These shorts are covered withthe borrowed stocks, and then the issuer delivers seeders their ETF shares.This has created a position of being long the ETF and short the correspondingbasket of underlying stocks. In certain circumstances, a long position in anETF and a short position in the underlying basket can be very profitablefrom a financing perspective. I discuss this type of trade in Chapter , whichexplains stock loan trading strategies. At other times, this can become anexpensive position for seeders for a variety of reasons, primarily becausethe costs typically are offset by the fees received for lending. But in a newETF there is little demand from shorts to borrow shares. It is, however,perfectly hedged with no market exposure and has a cost structure that canbe calculated in real time with no risk of slippage. Here is what the positionlooks like economicallyEconomics of a Seed Position Long ETFPaying financing charges on the money used to buy the ETFPaying the management feesReceiving the dividends paid on the stocks in the basket of the ETF Short Basket of StocksReceiving financing rates on the money received for selling the underlying stock in the creation unitPaying fees to borrow the basket of stocksPaying dividends on the basket of short stocksThese two positions create an arbitrage position because of the fungibility between the ETF and its underlying basket. In a typical  Act ETF,there is a basket of stocks underlying the ETF. Via the creation and redemption process, those two separate and distinct units can be exchanged foreach other in kind. In seeding, however, seeders need to sit with the positionuntil other assets are accumulated by the ETF or to sell out the positionin the secondary market. The underlying basket shares are borrowed anddelivered to the issuer the issuer then delivers shares of the ETF. The ETFis then listed on the exchange.Once the ETF is listed on the exchange, people inevitably in successfulissues buy the ETF. Only two market participants can possibly be sellingthe ETF shares at this early stage in its listed lifetime either the entity thatperformed the initial creation or the persons to whom it decided to lendthose shares to facilitate a short position. In the case of the LMM being theseed entity, this is a very clean process because it already has a position onP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEits books that is long ETF and short basket. This means it can be out on theexchange as an LMM and offer shares for sale to the public without havingto borrow them from someone else. Then every time it makes a sale of theETF shares, it unwinds a corresponding piece of its short basket positionby buying the shares back and returning its borrowed stock. This is a greatprocess because the LMM eventually sells its entire ETF position and buysback its underlying hedge of the short basket, thereby flattening its exposuresand freeing up the balance sheet consumed by the position. If there is goodvolume, the LMM will sell more than its initial creation position and haveto do further creations. This is how an ETF will grow its assets and sharesoutstanding.The ETF shares are then disbursed throughout the marketplace. Typically the ETF is sold to investors or traders who want the ETF shares forvarious reasons and are willing to take the directional risks associated witha long or short position in the ETF.Seeding away from the LMM A slightly more complicated format beginning to unfold in the market environment is seeding being undertaken by aparty other than the LMM. This concept is important to understand Eitherthe LMM seeds the ETF and it has shares to sell, or someone else seeds theETF and then lends those shares to the LMM for it to start trading. This issignificant the LMM must have shares to sell in the early days of trading,because typical initial interest in an ETF is from the buy side. If the LMMhad decided not to seed and did not borrow the shares, but then decidedto start trading the ETF, it could be out on the exchange but hesitant tosell any shares and would be bidding without offering at a valuable levelfor investors. If a fund was seeded by a party that is not the LMM but thatrefused to lend out the created ETF shares, it is effectively forcing the LMMinto an early creation.In practice, by assuming the LMM position in an ETF, you are eithergoing to seed or at least secure a stock borrow on the shares for the firstsettlement following the first trading day so you have some shares to sell.Doing this will allow you to make a market which will help to get thewheels moving. Lately the seeding process is moving away from the LMMs,not necessarily by choice, but because their ability and desire to providebalance sheet space to any fund that comes along has been greatly reduced.This situation is understandable and purely economic. The number of ETFshas exploded, and many of them need a longer incubation period, whichcan become an expensive drain on the balance sheet.The fact is that seeding is really just balance sheet rental it was originallypaid for by trading revenues received by the LMMs. Now they have decidedthey can pay to borrow those shares from an unrelated seeder and stillP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeBringing an ETF to the Market make enough profit to justify being in the LMM business. This has led tothe sudden creation of a new revenue stream for nonLMM seeders. If youseed a fund and are not the LMM, you have an immediate client in needof borrowing shares from you to cover potential shorts. This will not be alongterm revenue stream, however, because the LMM will not want to payborrowing fees for an extended amount of time on a small short position, andeventually it will be forced to create the ETF shares. New entrants cominginto the ETF market are willing to seed funds in an attempt to extract apiece of that revenue stream.Eventually a method for getting compensated for seeding new ETFs willdevelop. Typically LMMs seeded funds because they wanted listings. Thisalso facilitated the procedure of having shares to sell when the fund initiallylaunched. More recently, LMMs have become much more selective aboutseeding, resulting in a dearth of seed capital and a long pipeline of funds inqueue for listing. The difficulty of acquiring seed capital has a potentiallypositive effect on listing quality. As the costs to seed products increases,more thought will be put into the process of deciding which products to list.Better and more effective products will be listed, with the ones failing thevetting process destined for an eternity in registration.From an issuance standpoint, this is a bad situation. Issuers never wantthe expenses for trading or launching their fund to increase. To combatthis, the process of cutting creation unit sizes down has begun. Cutting thecreation unit size will decrease the amount of residual positions sitting onbooks around the Street. These positions are not large enough to process acreation and simply generate finance charges for the involved parties. Smallercreation units also make it less expensive to seed a fund.When a LMM sells an amount of the ETF that is less than a wholecreation unit, it must decide when to create shares to cover its short position.If the creation unit is , shares, and the LMM has sold , in themarket, it may not be inclined to process a creation, and therefore have along position of , shares that remains unsold. It may be willing tosit short the , shares and pay stock borrow fees to the seeder. Thedecision is whether to pay borrowing fees on the short or finance fees onthe long. This is the cost to carry the position and is built into ETF pricingspreads. Remember that all of these positions are hedged with baskets andare therefore not exposed to market movement risks.Typically because of the creationredemption feature of ETFs, the act ofgrowing your positions big enough will allow you to unwind them versus theissuer thus, you will have no, or very low, carrying costs. However, in a newETF, there is not always enough volume, and you will incur the costs oneway or the other. This fact explains why issuers are moving toward reducingthe size of the creation units in an attempt to lessen costs to clients. WeP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEdiscuss this topic again later when speaking more about executing hedgingbaskets.Risks to Seeding Executed properly, the risk associated with maintainingan initial creation unit is minimal. The main risk to seeding a new ETF iscarelessness in maintaining your hedged position. Many observers over thepast decade have erroneously assumed that the LMMs were seeding fundsby taking an outright long position in the fund. They believed that the LMMwas buying the underlying basket of the ETF, delivering that to the issuer,and receiving shares via the inkind creation feature. This would be leavingthe LMM with an outright long position in the ETF at the risk of the markets.This belief highlights a misunderstanding of what LMMs do and how ETFswork. LMMs, or any liquidity providers, are not in the business of takinglarge directional bets. Most of the time they pursue arbitrage opportunities,profiting from spreads either between the bid price and ask price or betweenone product and another. In the case of ETFs, the arbitrage occurs betweenthe ETF and its underlying basket.The risks to doing an initial seed creation can be summarized inthis way. Borrow costs increasing dramatically.. The short basket gets called back.. ETF AUM do not grow, leaving the seeder in the position for a longerthan expected time period.. The ETF exhibits tracking error versus the underlying basket.. Missing a corporate action in the underlying basket causes trackinglosses.In Exhibit . you can see an example of what a hedged position in anETF would look like in market value terms. When you do an initial seedcreation, you are delivering the exact basket of shares at the closing pricesand receiving the ETF shares at the net asset value NAV.EXCEL EXAMPLEThe spreadsheet entitled Creation Unit Seed Example shows the basketand value calculations that represent a fully hedged seed position. Youcan see how the basket and the required cash are interpolated into anNAV for the fund.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeBringing an ETF to the Market EXHIB IT .

This is the short market valueof the basket position at a specific time. You can see from the table thatthe market value of your short basket positions and your long ETF positionless any cash will be equivalent. You will have no market exposure becauseas the basket moves, the value of your ETF will move as well. The priceof the ETF in the market will potentially be trading at prices slightly awayfrom NAV. But if you enter and exit the ETF position via the creation andredemption mechanism, you remove any secondary market risk from theposition.Seed Pipel ine Seeding new funds is important because new fund launchesare the lifeline of the ETF issuer. When valuable new funds are brought tomarket, investors will benefit from various increases in potential exposures.It is important here to consider how ETF issuers get paid. Many people donot understand the general flow of assets into ETFs and how managementfees are extracted from those assets. It is also critical to understand that ETFsare bringing professionalquality investing tools and all of their benefits toa broad range of investors.We have discussed how during the creation process an Authorized Participant delivers the basket of shares to issuers in return for shares of theETF. Issuers have an inherent position in a  Act fund in which theyare essentially long the basket of stocks underlying the ETF and theoreticallyshort the ETF shares. In this case, however, issuers ETF position is considered to be shares outstanding and not an actual short position. The NAVof the ETF is the sum of the value of the stocks in the basket and any residualcash in the fund. In a typical equity ETF, the basket of stocks replicating theETF held by the issuer functions like any other group of stocks. It pays dividends and experiences corporate actions. The issuer maintains the basket toaccount for all the changes that occur. That is why there is always a smallP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEresidual cash position. Sometimes stocks exit the basket, and the money hasto be reallocated. At other times, a dividend is paid on a stock in the basketand will have to be paid out to ETF shareholders at the specified dividendpayment period for the ETF. The issuer typically accrues the fees daily andreceives those fees from the cash portion of the fund on a specified basis.The issuer is the last in line to receive payment through the whole processof issuing an ETF. It hires staff, builds a business, licenses or creates an index,and then pays legal fees, creates setup procedures, and writes prospectuses.Finally, after all of that expensive work, it may issue an ETF. The ETF mustgrow before it begins to generate any fees. The fee for the fund is based ona percentage of the assets under management. In the case of ETFs, the feestypically are less than many fund competitors of different types, specificallyclosedend funds CEFs, mutual funds, and hedge funds. ETF issuers do nothave upfront sales charges to incent brokers to sell the funds. There is nottypically an initial public offering IPO process whereby brokers generatefees from steering clients into the funds. Even the salespeople at a typicalETF issuer do not get paid transactionalbased commissions for selling ETFs.The ETF wholesaler is selling the concept of the ETFs in its product suite anddeveloping client utilization plans. This is much more of an educational rolethan a transactional commissionbased sales role. In the early years of ETFs,wholesalers would spend a lot of time and energy with clients educatingthem about the ETFs they are representing. Then when clients were readyto buy, wholesalers would tell clients to call their trading desks. ETF issuerstypically were detached from the execution process of their clients. Theseare not transactionbased positions and the issuers do not actually processtrades for clients directly.TRADING TIPNow issuers have adopted much more of an educational stance ontrading. Because of the introduction of products that are more sophisticated and trade less intraday volume, issuers have become moreinvolved in the trading process. Many issuers now have professionalsdedicated to the trading process, helping clients to understand it and, attimes, helping to facilitate trades. Many traders at the Authorized Participants can explain the various trading options and help customersexecute efficiently. Additionally, The ETF Handbook is a great toolfor wholesalers to help explain the processes and for the client base togain a greater understanding of the entire ETF mechanism.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeBringing an ETF to the Market Issuers start to generate revenues from ETFs when customer trades startto funnel through the system. First, the customer has to have a tradingsystem and brokerage account. Then the customer has to send the orderto the exchange, and when they trade, they generate a trading commission.The exchange generates fees for executing the trades. Clearing firms chargefees for processing the tickets. Finally, after enough shares of the ETF arebought, an AP does a creation, driving assets into the ETF. Then issuers canstart generating fees to cover all those upstream expenses they have alreadypaid to get the fund into the hands of their clients.COMPARING FEES BY STRUCTUREA look at the two main competitors to ETFs, mutual and closedend funds,reveals how they generate their fees and their differences. Like ETFs, bothcompeting products charge management fees as a percentage of the assetsunder management of the fund. A CEF launches via an IPO. The sales teamgets paid in the form of a sales commission based on how many shares of theoffering it sells. This diminishes the risk that the CEF is going to launch andwill not have enough shares outstanding to generate the requisite fees. Oncesold, those shares are not redeemable except under special circumstancesactivists and other types of open endings. Management fees are generatedon a large amount of assets from the first day of trading. Before the fund hasgenerated anything in terms of performance or even traded a single share,there are enough assets locked in indefinitely to pay the fees.CEFs have an interesting place in the investing world. After they issuetheir fixed amount of shares via the IPO, the markets take over the pricingrelationship between the fund and its NAV. There are really only two thingsthat can happen next. The fund can be well received, causing many people to want to buy itand causing it to move to a premium. At that point, the CEF issuer caneither institute a rights issue to get more shares out to the marketplaceto satisfy demand or can launch a similar fund and have its sales teamsell it to clients for another IPO.. Alternatively the CEF can move to a discount. Many of those investorswho paid NAV plus a small percentage commission to get shares on theIPO will instantly underperform the NAV performance by the sellingconcession and the discount move.The process by which investors utilize mutual funds is interesting aswell. Investors deliver the fund company cash. The fund company thenP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEissues new shares to account for the investors position in the fund. In manycases, mutual funds know a lot about the client base. By knowing exactlywho your clients are at all times, you can market directly to your customerbase. You can pay your sales force based on clearly delineated asset flows. Insome cases, customers are paying a frontend load just to get into the fund.The reporting of underlying holdings is different from ETFs as well. Mutualfunds and CEFs typically report holdings on a quarterly or semiannual basis.The transparency required of an ETF ensures that investors will know whatthe fund is holding every day.The ETF wrapper is proving to be a very strong competitor in the investment company landscape. Demand continues to grow for more productsand expanded exposures. A large amount of issuance is needed and forthcoming to bring out products that are less expensive and can perform betterthan the more traditional products. A lot of assets can and probably willbe moved over to the structure over time. Throughout the history of products, there are many examples that ended up not enriching to investors ascompared to their issuers, the ETF wrapper is unique in its approach andis proving beneficial to both. You typically do get transparency, liquidity,and tax efficiency when you use these products properly. As the universegrows through the new issuance process, investors will reap the rewardsof an inexpensive, liquid, and diverse set of investment products that bringmany of the qualities of institutional investing to the individual investorlevel.MARKETING AND LAUNCHOnce the mechanics of the fund have been put in place, the issuer is readyto launch the ETF. Currently in the United States, listing takes place oneither the NYSE Arca or the Nasdaq. The NYSE Arca now lists morethan  of the available ETFs in the United States. Several new tradingvenues are gearing up to attempt to break this stronghold by the main listingexchanges.The last thing done in the process of listing the ETF is the selection ofan LMM and the initial seed creation. Finally it is simply a matter of pickinga day when everything will be in order for the exchange to alert membersand turn on trading. At this point the ETF begins a life of its own. Unlikea stock or a closedend fund with a limited amount of shares outstanding,this is a vehicle with assets and shares outstanding that will grow and shrinkwith demand and interest. ETFs can grow extremely quickly or more slowly,depending on circumstances.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeBringing an ETF to the Market ETFs sometimes are thought to be bought by clients and not necessarilysold by salespeople. This makes the marketing process critical to the entirelaunch of a new product. Utilizing the various outlets available for developing a message enables investors to understand ETFs on a more subliminallevel. Because there are so many products, investors seem to approach theproduct suites in two main ways. Some go for a particular fund family,similar to what they might do in any other fund investment scenario. Andothers consider use of the ETF product line segmentation enough. Theypursue the variety of products available to them regardless of the issuingcompany.In recent years, funds have launched and closed that have presentedcompelling products from an investing standpoint but were not able toachieve the critical mass necessary for survival. Some of these closures canbe attributed to inefficient marketing tactics. The marketing of products forinvestment is a delicate balance of branding and product positioning.CONCLUSIONLaunching an ETF is an extremely complicated and involved process. Thereare major expenses involved in resolving potential legal issues and developinga full investment mechanism around a product. Because of the size of themarket, a firm launching one or two niche products will have a difficult fightfor survival against the behemoths with their marketing machines.The changes in the financial markets over the last several years and thegrowth of the product set has made it more difficult both to secure an LMMand to get seed capital for launching new funds. Once those obstacles areovercome, it is still a difficult battle to get people to focus attention on newproducts amid a rising cacophony of new product announcements. Thereare approximately  ETFs in registration even if just a small percentageof those are brought to market, there will be a significant population ofproducts, in addition to the more than  already listed. The number willgrow even further as more products migrate over from competing structures.And there is the incessant demand from the investing community throughout the world for new funds and products that offer ever more arcaneexposures.It is imperative for the growth of the ETF wrapper that the incubationprocess is advanced. It would be fruitless to discuss the merits of selectingliquid baskets that provide valuable investments if it were impossible tobring new products to market.

The three largest categories were mutualfunds . trillion, ETFs  billion, including non Act funds, andclosedend funds CEFs  billion. Every investorfrom small households to large institutionsutilizes funds. In the year , mutual fundsaccounted for more than  of assets invested in funds, with almost  trillion in assets. At that time, CEFs managed approximately  billion, morethan double the assets of the nascent ETF industry, which was managingjust  billion in assets. If you fastforward to the end of , ETFs weremanaging roughly  of all fund assets and had eclipsed the assets of theirCEF cousins.A look at asset growth in terms of new issuance and assets under management AUM among ETFs, CEFs, and mutual funds over the last sevenyears suggests that mutual funds may be losing their stranglehold on theindustry.

Since then people have been discussing the reasons fortheir most notable characteristic They have a tendency to trade at sometimes significant premiums or discounts to their net asset value NAV. Asdiscussed in detail throughout this book, if an ETF is trading away from itsNAV, you can buy or sell the ETF and the underlying basket and exchangethe two via the creation and redemption mechanism. This ability does notexist in the CEF world. CEFs issue a fixed number of shares at NAV duringan initial public offering IPO process, and that outstanding share numberstays relatively stable throughout the life of the fund. Rights offerings andbuybacks can change shares outstanding. Although you cannot pursue apure arbitrage like that available in a domestic ETF, you can trade discountdislocations over time.There are, however, many similarities between ETFs and CEFs worthnoting They both are listed and traded on an exchange. Because they are listed, they both can be bought and sold at any timeduring market hours, and they enjoy all the same order types availableto standard equities. They generally have low and similar levels of portfolio turnover. They can be purchased on margin. They can be sold short.There are also some significant differences CEFs have a fixed number of outstanding shares, whereas ETFs cancreate and redeem outstanding shares daily. CEFs are launched via an IPO process while ETFs are seeded with aninitial investment amount and begin trading with listing. CEFs can and generally do trade at premiums and discounts to NAVmost ETFs trade in a tight band immediately around NAV. CEFs cannot source liquidity from the underlying basket as ETFs can.Many retail investors have grown comfortable with the CEF producttype over the years, drawn into the products by high yields and deep discounts. A deep discount, however, does not help performance unless thereP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEis some form of discount narrowing event. And many investors have comeinto the CEF product type in an IPO at a price slightly above NAV only tosee those products move to a discount to NAV and remain there.People typically pursue three types of trades in the CEF arena when theyare trying to achieve outsized market returns. Discount trading and investing. Following activist investors. CEFETF conversion tradesMany users of CEFs were early adopters of the ETF structure. This isimportant because there are many opportunities to trade ETFs and CEFs inconjunction with each other. For those CEF specialists who were pursuingstrategies in which they tried to capture discount moves, the ETF was agreat initial hedging tool. An educated investor or advisor was able to buildportfolios combining both wrappers in the early days of ETFs, while theproduct offerings were still limited. This is true even today. You can pursuearbitrage opportunities between the two asset classes or rotate positionsbetween the two for investment purposes.Given the similarities, it makes sense that recent developments in technology and changes in mindset that have driven growth in ETFs have helpedthe CEF marketplace to grow as well. This trend, however, is beginning toreverse. The explosion of ETF types pursuing active management, leverage,and hardtoreach asset classes are now pursuing a full frontal attack on theCEF market and the issuance numbers, as displayed in Exhibit ., tell aclear story about the future.Due to the growth and expansion of the ETF market, many new opportunities have arisen to trade the two asset classes against each other. Severalexamples of CEFs converting to the ETF structure exist, and likely manymore are forthcoming. In  Morgan Stanley and Barclays teamed upand listed  products called World Equity Benchmark Shares WEBS onthe American Stock Exchange Amex. The June  issue of DerivativesStrategy magazine wrote WEBS exchangetraded index funds representa clear assault on offshore singlecountry funds closed or open. Thoseproducts still exist but have been rebranded as a part of the iShares suite ofETFs and have experienced great asset growth. One of the notable funds inthe beginning of this convergence trade was the Claymore Raymond JamesSB Fund RYJ. This was a CEF issued by Claymore Advisors one of thefew issuers of both ETFs and CEFs with a statement in its prospectus thatmandated a conversion vote to an ETF if the fund traded at a discount greaterthan  over a specific time period. This fund has since converted to theETF structure and has become a case study for how the same fund worksP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeInvestment Companies, Now and in the Future in both structures. That fund conversion helped to significantly and permanently reduce the persistent discount of the CEF and was closely watched asa model for potential future conversions.I think a very large convergence trade will play out over the next decadeas the two products become even more closely intermingled. I would expectmany assets to shift from the CEF structure into that of the ETF. Therecently announced purchase of iShares by Blackrock will potentially bringmany more conversiontype trades in the future as two large and distinctasset management businesses are merged.Comparing L iqu id i ty and TradingIn the comparison of underlying liquidity available between a CEF and anETF, there is one extremely important difference openended issuance viacreations and redemptions. Exhibit . shows liquidity calculations betweentwo products providing similar exposures. I take the underlying basket andapply the calculations for the implied daily tradable shares IDTS number.You can see that ETF A is implying  million shares while CEF A isimplying a respectable  million shares available to be traded during theday. These numbers are much larger than the current average daily volumesin both funds. They represent the number of shares that could be tradedin the fund by trading the requisite stocks in the underlying basket.

Instead, even though thisETF trades only , shares per day on average, an investor who wantedto position a much larger block of the ETF could do so via trading in theunderlying basket.In the CEF, however, there is no conversion between the underlyingbasket and the CEF shares. So even though the basket underlying the CEF isimplying a reasonable amount of liquidity, the volume that can be traded isconstrained to liquidity present in the marketplace. It would be reasonable toassume, therefore, that if you try to buy or sell more than  of the typicalaverage daily volume of the CEF, you will have an impact on the price ofthat product. With an ETF, while trading the basket you are afforded muchmore potential liquidity. As I mentioned, the ETF will trade around NAV asconstrained by the arbitrage mechanism. The lack of that mechanism willrelease the CEF to trade at any level that the market determines appropriate.Comparing DiscountsAt the end of  and into early , the discounts on CEFs widenedto levels that had not been seen for many years. This can be seen clearlyin Exhibit . showing the average closed end fund discount over time forall funds. Looking backward from September , there was an incredibleopportunity to trade broad swaths of the asset class, either from an outrightinvestment perspective or on a hedged basis attempting to isolate just thediscount move, at very cheap discounts to NAV.Discounts are a direct result of an important difference between ETFsand CEFs that takes place in the beginning of their life cycle. An ETF gets itsfirst assets via the initial creation unit as described in detail in Chapter .This initial creation unit occurs at NAV, and then shares are offered to thepublic in the secondary market on the exchange. Assets in the fund andshares outstanding can grow and shrink on a daily basis, reflecting changesin demand for the fund. Because of this creation and redemption processand therefore the ability to arbitrage away valuation differentials betweenthe underlying basket and the ETF price, ETF prices tend to trade at or closeto NAV. Discounts are not persistent in ETFs. If they exist at all, they area function of the liquidity of the underlying basket. Special events, such asrestrictions of trading in the underlying basket, will drive ETFs to a premiumor discount until those restrictions are removed. The discounts that may beobserved in an ETF with international constituents are a price discoveryfunction and are discussed in detail in Chapter .By contrast, a CEF is launched via the IPO process with a fixed amountof shares issued. There is a general tendency for CEFs to move to a discountP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEwithin one year after launch. But they can also move to a premium if thereis high demand for the fixed amount of shares. The fixed share amount isone of the main factors in the tendency of CEFs to trade at large premiumsand discounts for extended time periods. This fixed share quantity leavesprices to move based on supply and demand of the fund shares. In essence,this is a function of the fact that liquidity providers cannot do creations andredemptions to satisfy and balance demand. If you cannot adjust outstandingshares or assets to account for demand, then concerns regarding fundmanagement and performance expectations should, and do, have an impacton price in the market in relation to NAV.Est imat ing CEF NAVs There is an interesting aspect to trading closedendfunds that actually ties in well to the ETF world. When CEFs are tradedduring the trading day, larger institutional investors use an estimated NAVeNAV to approximate the CEFs fair value. This process of estimatingthe NAV or the value of the underlying assets in the fund is the same aswhat needs to be done with an ETF with an underlying basket that is nottrading at the same time as the ETF. While an ETF publishes an intradayindicative value IIV that gives an approximate value of the fund based onthe last price, this value is really valuable only for a fund with a basketof underlying securities trading at the same time. I first learned the maintechniques of estimating NAVs as a CEF trader in the mids whenI was running portfolios of CEFs, providing liquidity and trading discounts.In certain respects, an ETF trading during the U.S. hours with an underlyingbasket of international stocks is very similar to a CEF. However, becauseof the creation and redemption mechanism, ETFs and CEFs have differentdiscount or premium time frames. The discount or premium of a CEF movesover longer time frames and is reasonably stable on a daytoday basis.Since there is no mechanism actually to contract that discount spread, itcan be perpetual. The price of an ETF with underlying stocks trading in adifferent time zone will drift away from underlying value during the tradingday, reflecting future value expectations, and then will adjust for overnighttrading near the open of the next days trading. Intraday, the ETF is tradingas a price discovery vehicle for the next market open. The CEF price, bycontrast, is reflecting sentiment of investors over a longer term.MUTUAL FUNDSFive years ago, a comparison between ETFs and CEFs might have been mostappropriate because of their relative market sizes. Now, given the growthtrajectory of ETFs, it is appropriate to compare them to the much largermutual fund category. The growth of the ETF marketplace has highlighted aP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeInvestment Companies, Now and in the Future potential that is being compared very closely to the mutual fund industry.One of the comments I hear often about the proliferation of ETFs is howmany products the investing world needs within the ETF wrapper. If youcompare the ETF industry with just over  products listed in the UnitedStates compared to the roughly , mutual funds, you can extrapolatea much steeper growth curve. Even within the landscape of indextrackingfunds, there are dozens of mutual funds tracking the same  stocks in theStandard  Poors  and trying to replicate or outperform its returns.Since in the ETF world there are only  major and fewer than  competingfunds providing exposure similar to the SP , there is much growthpotential.This potential for future growth has been highlighted by the entranceof some of the largest players in the mutual fund industry into the ETFlandscape. Vanguard entered the ETF business in  by creating a separateshare class of its existing mutual funds. The firm helped feed assets into itsETFs via the creation of a oneway gate permitting index fund holders toroll positions into the ETFs. Vanguard is now the thirdlargest ETF providerwith almost  billion in assets, as of September . Bond fund managerPacific Investment Management Co. PIMCO entered the ETF market inMay . And on January , , Charles Schwab  Co. filed to createand list ETFs, which they began listing in November . The first fundthat they proposed listing is intended to track the Dow Jones U.S. totalstock market index. This fund will be very similar to already existing fundsby both iShares and State Street.This will also be a test of the strength of firstmover advantage in theETF space. It will be difficult for late entrants into the category to gain afoothold unless they bring something unique to the table. Vanguard broughtits lowerfee method of providing index exposure, and PIMCO is planningon bringing its fixedincome investing prowess. It will be interesting to seewhat other new entrants bring to the competition for assets.Trading ETFs and Mutual FundsThe broad ETF marketing machine has been preparing for an epic battle forassets between the structures. For years ETF issuers have touted the benefitsof the structures intraday trading and liquidity, transparency of holdings,tax efficiency, and cost effectiveness. The mutual fund machine has beenfiring back about the lack of liquidity in many ETFs. Although many of thenewer ETFs do exhibit low intraday trading volume, it may not be correctto judge them using that as a negative characteristic.Lets take a look at the trading and execution of mutual funds first.When you are a buyer of a mutual fund, either directly from the fund familyP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEor via a mutual fund supermarket, you essentially send in a check for thenotional amount that you wish to purchase. The fund issues you new sharesoutstanding at the NAV of the fund. This has become an easily understoodand popular system for investors. For the most part, you can request to buyor sell whatever your notional amount is in the product on any given day.There are two potential drawbacks, however, to this system.. If there is major news out in the middle of any trading day, you are unable to adjust your exposure to your particular mutual fund investment.. If at the end of the same day you and many other investors have allchosen to exit, there will be an extraordinarily large amount of stockselling pressure into the market closing.These two circumstances are addressed effectively within the ETF structure. The first one is addressed via the listing of an ETF on the exchange.This listing enables a person to buy or sell shares of the ETF during the trading day. This trading can be done to initiate or unwind existing positionsor to adjust positions that might have been attained via the primary marketusing the creation or redemption process. Lets see how this addresses thechance that your position in a lowvolume ETF might seem to restrict yournotional trading ability.If the ETF has a basket of domestic underlying stocks and the ETFitself typically does not trade a lot of volume, then you will need to use theservices of a liquidity provider or Authorized Participant AP in the ETF.The AP will provide a link between the investor and the basket in order toexecute larger notional sizes than might be easily traded in the market. In anETF with domestic underlying stocks, typically the liquidity providers haveelectronic market making systems to facilitate order flow in these namesautomatically in the market. This can also be done by giving a portfoliotrading desk an order to execute the underlying basket on your behalf andgive you the implied execution in the ETF. The ETF basket is transparentand published daily making it possible to enhance liquidity by utilizing theunderlying basket. So while onesided pressure will affect the price of anETF too, a few avenues of liquidity can be tapped to dampen the effect.In addition, all sellers or buyers of an ETF are not pigeonholed to theclose. They can spread out their activity so it creates less price impact. InExhibit . I describe the IDTS as the function of how much liquidity canbe created in the ETF by utilizing the basket.Lets take a look at the difference with an ETF that has underlyingshares trading at times when the ETF typically is not trading. The ETF withinternational constituents gives you two different times to trade the product Large investors can trade the ETF in the marketplace, either utilizingwhat liquidity exists or asking a participant to provide some liquidity, orP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeInvestment Companies, Now and in the Future you can go into the underlying local markets and have someone trade theunderlying basket on your behalf, then give you the ETF price as impliedby the basket executions. Because you can attain executions on your ETForder flow throughout the trading day, via either the ETF or the underlyingbasket, you are not subject to potentially erratic closing prices due to largemarket pressures.So while it may seem that an ETF trading with a low intraday volumemight not offer the same liquidity as a similar mutual fund, that is notnecessarily the case. The liquidity for both will be based on the underlyingbasket, but with an ETF you will have the ability to access that basket indifferent ways potentially throughout the trading day. With a mutual fund,you are leaving that execution discretion to the portfolio management team.It is this secondary source of liquidity, the intraday trading, that essentiallyprovides an extra layer of risk to your ETF position if it is needed. In manycases of investandhold behavior, this extra source of liquidity may not bea tremendous perceived benefit. As with other insurance, it is best not tohave to use it but nice to know it exists if necessary.Although the early ETF products have been mostly index based andhave some different characteristics from traditional actively managed mutualfunds, as ETFs evolve they are expected to present a full frontal attack onthe mutual fund industry. The growth in the actively managed ETF spaceis just beginning fewer than a dozen products exist in the market that aredesigned as actively managed portfolios for competing against traditionalstyle mutual funds.ACTIVELY MANAGED ETFsIf you are an index fund, it is easy to develop a level of comfort fromproducing a daily file of your investment holdings. Typically, an index fundis rules based, and investors understand those rules the passive manageraims to replicate those rules to track the benchmark. Although there issome variability in how they are devised, the indexes usually announcetheir changes in advance. Additionally, they have clear rules for how theyhandle corporate actions and other index events. An ETF tracking an indexwill pursue the same strategy pending changes can be anticipated priorto them being made. This feature has helped in the growth of the ETFindustry because it facilitates the maintenance and trading of positions inthe ETFs. As is explained in detail throughout the book, a liquidity providerin an ETF typically uses the underlying basket of securities to hedge itsposition. Enabling them to maintain their positions in conjunction with thefunds allowing them to facilitate liquidity and other demands, like stockloans.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEThe most frequently listed advantages of ETFstheir underlying liquidity and their portfolio transparencyhave been the biggest detractors inthe evolution of actively managed ETF strategies. The underlying conceptbehind an actively managed ETF is that the portfolio manager will be ableto adjust the portfolio as needed or desired while not being subject to theset rules of an index. The active manager aims to beat a benchmark and hasto devise trading models and strategies to do so. Because very few portfoliomanagers are willing to divulge their next portfolio move for fear of frontrunning by other investors, ETFs with active portfolio managers have beenslow to gain a foothold.Although the problem seems twopronged, liquidity and transparency,one problem stems from the other. It is very difficult for an ETF to exhibitintraday trading liquidity without transparency of holdings. Yet intradayliquidity, while a significant potential benefit of ETFs, is not a prerequisitefor listing or even for success. Many of the more recently listed ETFs aredesigned as investment vehicles. They are not replicating indexes and arenot intended to be for day trading or shortterm position allocations. Theyare intended, instead, as investment vehicles for longterm positions withina portfolio and can easily be utilized as such. Although intraday liquidity isconstantly referred to as a major benefit of the ETF structure, its creationand redemption feature and its state of continuous issuance is what trulyfacilitates asset growth. These benefits can drive utilization of an ETF witheven the lowest daily trading volume.Two other attributes are driving a move toward actively managedETFs. Portfolio managers may be able to take advantage of the tax efficiencyof the structure for better portfolio management.. The investor base sees the potential for lower costs consistent with thecurrent funds in the ETF structure.It will be interesting to see how these funds develop and grow over thenext few years.ETFs WITHIN THE PORTFOLIOThere are three main uses for ETFs within the scope of portfolioconstruction. Asset allocation. Risk management. Cash managementP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeInvestment Companies, Now and in the Future Almost every portfolio use for the products will satisfy a test allocatingthem to one of those groups.Asset Al locat ionI use the broad category of asset allocation to cover all directional positioningwith the intention of achieving the broad investment goals of the portfolio.You can use the ETF structure for a core or satellite approach to yourexposures. You can fill buckets that satisfy needs for currency exposure andcommodities weightings. Additionally, you can now achieve diversified andefficient fixedincome exposures through the use of the ETF wrapper.Performance With the proliferation of ETFs covering an immense numberof strategies, there has arisen the ability to trade various strategies againsteach other while staying within the ETF structure. Dozens of asset management firms run portfolios limited to the use of the ETFs structure. A searchon Google for ETF portfolios will reap more than  million results. Theseportfolios are offering less risk because of the diversification of the underlying assets and the diversification among various ETFs. They are attemptingto take advantage of momentum strategies or generating alpha within theportfolios by their sector selection techniques.There are significant opportunities to take advantage of longterm market trends by playing embedded ETF strategies against each other. For example, there are viable strategies where you may be long a fundamentallyweighted ETF and short a market capitalization  weighted ETF, attemptingto capture outperformance of one strategy versus another over a given timeperiod. Investors can take advantage of the different strategies by attempting to isolate investment climates, determining when each strategy shouldperform better than the other and positioning both sides. These strategiesdid not exist before the proliferation of readily traded basket products inthe form of ETFs.F inancing The growth in the number of ETFs and the ability to have severaldifferent ETFs covering a similar exposure or strategy has created opportunities for taking advantage of financing differentials. If you are holding along position in a specific ETF and the management fee of another correlating product is less expensive, you can easily roll from one product to itscompetitor. One of the largest product sponsors in the marketplace developed much of its strategy around offering ETFs at a cheaper management feethan its already established competitor. Additionally, this company offerssome differences in how the portfolios are managed and optimized. Thereare also opportunities to reposition yourself if you discover that you can gaina better rebate on loaning one ETF versus another one in which you mayP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEalready have a position. This is typically a case where you would roll froma more popular ETF, where the market for stock loan is heavily monitored,to a newer ETF, where the market might be less developed but there is stillsome demand for the shares.Structure There are also differences in structure that have become moreimportant as the product lines have developed. If there is only one productcovering the particular sector or currency that you are seeking to position,choice is not available. However, the recent market dislocation in the end of into  has established the importance of choosing your investmentstructure carefully. If you can achieve a similar exposure by using a productin the ETF structure with a segregated underlying basket versus a structurein which you accept the credit risk of an issuer or third party, there areimportant decisions to be made. A main advantage of the ETF structure is itsinherent simplicity. ETFs have transparency of underlying constituents andlack embedded credit risks. It is important to utilize products that achievethese goals or provide something of comparable value in exchange.Strategy Iso lat ion Another strategy in which ETFs are very useful is isolating exposures for specific trades. Those strategies that highlight ways togenerate an absolute return are always favorable in a highvolatility environment. ETFs can be used to isolate market exposure either by a specificsector or market bucket or to remove exposure entirely. If you are isolatinga specific stock for investment but want to try to eliminate a large portion ofthe market risk embedded in the position, you can use a short position in anETF for protection. Now your performance will be based on stockspecificnews and not news affecting the sector or broad market as a whole. Thereare more opportunities than ever before to locate a tailored hedge for yourdesired exposure.An example would be a long position in a large multinational bank basedin the United Kingdom versus a short position in an ETF that tracks theinternational financial sector as a hedge. Before the launch of internationalsector funds, you would have to position in either a domestic sector ETF orcreate your own basket of shorts. The growth of products enables you toachieve extremely tactical positions. If you are positioning the long becauseyou expect some type of event to cause an outsized move in the stock but donot want to be broadly exposed to the sector overall, you can now set up aspread trade to achieve this goal.Risk ManagementThis brings us to the topic of the risk management utility of ETFs. In thesector example just given, you are able to better manage the risk of theP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeInvestment Companies, Now and in the Future position because of alpha isolation from your sector hedge. Understandingthe techniques in achieving executions via using the underlying baskets orutilizing risk markets or algorithms can help you achieve exposures in thesenewer products that are designed for tactical use and have lower intradaytrading volumes.The ability to short ETFs on the downtick has always been a valuablefeature of the ETF wrapper. This feature helped create an important rolefor the product hedging portfolio risk. The fact that ETFs were tradingsmoothly without a tick test has helped bring the rest of the U.S. markets upto speed in that respect in recent years.In comparison to a traditional hedging product, a future, an ETF position can result in several benefits for the position. The most obvious is thefact that futures expire. In order to maintain a position for an extended timeframe, you must roll your position from one contract to the next. There isno rolling necessary when maintaining a short hedge, or a long position, inan ETF. Since ETFs are considered equities, there is also no need for additional accounts to trade them. With the recent market discussions regardingleveraged products, however, there eventually may be a requirement similarto the standard optionsfutures agreement needed to trade them in customeraccounts.The inherent nature of a basket product aids in risk management withina portfolio. Eliminating singlestock risks for all but specific instances hasbeen shown to potentially reduce portfolio risks. There are instances, however, where even basket diversity will not completely shield portfolios fromlosses. The Financial Select Sector SPDR XLF was an ETF that underwent a substantial stress test in its underlying constituents but still managed to provide comparably safe diversity. During the period September through September , ,  of XLFs  largest holdings were involvedin major financial transactions, including mergers, recapitalizations, or direct investments. The performance of the ETF served to cushion the blow inthat sector as compared to having positions in any of those particular stocksdirectly.Cash ManagementThere are several different features of cash management. One is the act ofmanaging cash positions using the short and extremely shortterm fixedincome products. The growth in the fixedincome product sector in ETFs hasled to the development of several different ways to manage cash positionswith extremely shortduration products.And there is cash equitization for managing cash inflows and redemptions to reduce portfolio drag. Transition management has becomean extremely large business for the ETF market. Because of the liquidityP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEand openended issuance of the ETF structure, it is now possible to findETFs that track very closely to the intended goals of the portfolio and rollpositions into those ETFs at times of change. Instead of managing an entireportfolio of stocks, it is possible to manage one simple position designedto track very closely to your benchmark. Additionally, the lack of timeframe requirements for this process of rolling into the ETF and then rollingout either in pieces or all at once has simplified the process of managingtransitions.CLOSING OF ETFsI once asked a journalist friend why newspaper articles always seem to have anegative slant. He told me about the statistics of readership and how positivestories do not sell newspapers. Judging from the tendency of financial writersto be preternaturally attracted to negative stories on the ETF industry, I amgoing to assume the same statistics apply when discussing financial products.There have been many fund closures in the ETF world over the last severalyears, and they have received extraordinary press coverage. There is even anETF death watch that ranks ETFs and tries to project which funds mightnot survive.It is a fact of life that ETFs close. Although this is certainly a negativefor investors, it should not be viewed as a stain on the ETF industry as awhole. It makes no sense to maintain ETFs that have not attracted sufficientassets. They become a drag on the entire product line. Culling the herd isimportant for the cash flow of the products and the health of the overallproduct structure. This is common in most fund structures. As Lisa Smithwrote, Several hundred [mutual] funds closed nearly every year during thelate s and the early s. Niche funds are particularly vulnerable.According to Investment Company Institute data, more than  mutualfunds either merged or liquidated in . This is a natural process for anytype of fund business.It is important to note that one of the main benefits of ETFs also turnsout to be a benefit when ETFs close. Because of the creation and redemption mechanism of ETFs and the inkind transfer of assets both processesare detailed in later chapters, closing an ETF and unwinding the assetsgenerally does not create a taxable event for the ETF. Because funds thatclose are typically very small, sometimes the closing entails a return of theunderlying shares to the initial seeder, with that party returning the ETFshares. This would be an inkind transaction between the ETF providerand the AP and would not generate any potential trading gains or losses.This is very different from the procedure for a mutual fund, which wouldP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeInvestment Companies, Now and in the Future either have to merge or sell the basket of securities underlying the assets ofthe fund.There are many reasons why a fund might close, mostly economic.The fundissuing company assumes all the expenses related to developmentand production of an ETF before it is launched. Additionally it pays theexpenses required for listing and launch and to keep the funds running.Most of this is done before the fund has even started to collect assets that willgenerate revenue. Issuers of ETFs are in the business to make money. Theyare offering products that are valuable for investors, but their underlyinggoal is a profit at the end of the day. Why keep funds listed in perpetuity ifthey have not generated a stable asset base Until recently it was cheaper tolaunch ETFs because seed capital was readily available, which made listingand maintaining some funds less expensive. The issuers listed as much aspossible in the race to reach critical mass.The process has changed seed capital and initial capital infusions intofunds are not as easy to secure. This fact is leading the issuers to proceedmuch more carefully in fund listings, which will lead to fewer closures downthe road with a much higher success rate on listed products. Also it willlead to a rise in the average assets gained in the initial and early years oflisting. The market has already moved from launches of  funds at a timeto typical launches of  or  funds at a time.CONCLUSION THE FUTURE OF ETFsThere are currently over  ETFs in registration for listing a recent listis available in Appendix D. They cover almost every imaginable cornerof the investing spectrum, from new leveraged products, to fixed incometo statebased funds. Many of these products in registration probably willnever be listed on a U.S. exchange. There are possibly several thousandmore yet to be conceived or developed that will be listed over the next fewyears.When I first encountered ETFs in the late s, I felt that I was ontosomething unique and different. That has proven to be a keen insight andone that has benefited me well during my career. Only time will tell whatthe future looks like, but here is a list of some ETFrelated items that wouldbe beneficial to have or could potentially develop as the industry continuesto evolveETF incubation. With the structural changes in the market over the lastseveral years and the decrease in participation of the lead marketmakers in seeding and providing adequate startup liquidity, newP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come INTRODUCTION TO THE ETF MARKETPLACEETFs will need an incubator program. This might come from theexchanges or from a third party but will be based around financinglaunches and providing liquidity in new products.Trading efficiencies. In order to continue the growth pattern that hasdeveloped over the last decade, better education of trading for newusers is required. The development of an NAV crossing methodology to facilitate trading will be a major advance in helping smallerplayers get efficient execution in the products. Automating the stockloan process and centralizing pricing and availability would enablelarger users to streamline their financing activities and utilize theproducts in a more costeffective manner.New entrants. The ramifications of the Barclays Global InvestorsBlackrock deal have yet to be seen but will be monumental. PIMCOis just starting to get involved in launching product, and CharlesSchwab  Co. has listed products toward the end of . Theseare three of the largest market participants in the world, and theiractions will have repercussions throughout the entire fund industryfor years to come. There are also the smaller, more nimble, and typically more creative new entrants beginning to launch active fundsand other strategies. Although the barriers to entry and success areformidable, I have no doubt that some of them will produce veryvaluable products.Product listing efficiencies. In ETFs where the underlying basket is trading at the same time as the ETF, automated systems will provideliquidity based on both pieces automatically. So, in a traditionally lowvolume ETF that has a basket replicating the SP , amarket participant will be able to access that underlying liquidityin a seamless manner. This access will probably be a componentof smaller creation unit sizes throughout the product structure. Itwill serve to even the playing field between highvolume and lowvolume products with similar underlying. Consider two productsthat are both designed to track the SP . One trades more volume because it has been around for a long time and has gaineduse as a proxy. If electronic systems provide ample liquidity in theETFs based on the underlying basket, then theoretically both ETFscould trade the same amount of liquidity at the same market width.The highvolume product would have an advantage over the otherproduct only if the volume proved to narrow the market spread toa level that is tighter than the basket itself.

This will also help in determining whether the price in themarket place is attractive or unattractive based on what is happening in related instruments available to be traded simultaneously. I have encounteredmany client questions over the years as to why an ETF was trading at acertain price or spread. A frequent situation revolves around clients callingto inquire about an ETF buy order that is not getting filled by the liquidityproviders. Typically, it is roughly  cents below the intraday indicativevalue IIV of the fund. Many times solving these issues is just a matter ofclearing up misperceptions about intraday values and pricing relationships.A main factor in valuing an ETF is having an understanding of thedifference between the indicative optimized portfolio value IOPV, alternatively called the intraday indicative value, and the net asset value NAV.In many of the U.S. domestic ETFs, that understanding will be enough totrade them efficiently.

This is where we start the discussion of valuation.We begin with the calculation of the net asset value NAV of the fundsand then explore discounts and premiums and cash amounts, ending at thecalculation of the intraday indicative value IIV.The ETFs with domestic constituents are the largest category of funds.They make up approximately  of all U.S.listed ETF assets. A highlevelbreakdown of the ETFs available with domestic underlying constituents canbe seen in the grid in Exhibit ..The structure of the ETF is based on holdings transparency. One ofthe keys to being transparent is publishing all of the numbers required tocalculate the fair value of an ETF every day. Six elements involved in thevaluation of an ETF are published every day. Net asset value. Intraday indicative value. Total cash. Estimated cash. Shares outstanding. Accrued dividends certain funds onlyThe NAV shows the most recent official value of the ETF based on themost recent market close. The IIV is the calculation of the most recent valueof the fund based on market prices of the underlying securities. The total andestimated cash amounts are the amount of excess cash in the fund.

This gives the fund a standardizedvalue that can be compared to other funds for performance statistics andaccounting. The fund world is based on comparative statistics, so uniformreporting was critical in the development of ETFs.The NAV of the ETF is calculated by taking the sum of the assets in thefund, including any securities and cash, subtracting out any liabilities, anddividing that by the number of shares outstanding.NAV  Assets  LiabilitiesShares OutstandingP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETFs with Domestic Constituents All of these data points are provided on a daily basis, including exactlywhat the fund is holding. This transparency frequently is touted as a majorbenefit of an ETF. Mutual and closedend funds are not required to provideportfolio holdings on a daily basis. A mutual fund provides a daily NAV butholdings are released quarterly. A closedend fund provides an NAV eitherdaily or weekly with holdings released usually quarterly. In an ETF, you areable to see the exact assets and aggregate liabilities of the fund at any time.This is also a factor which has worked to prevent against style drift in theproducts.The easiest way to calculate the NAV of an ETF is to use the creationunit CU and total cash published daily.NAV Shares per each component stock  Last PriceCU Shares  Total CashCU SharesThe NAV of an ETF is represented in share price terms.

This is arrived atby dividing the total cash amount by the creation unit shares amountCash per ETF Share  Total CashCU SharesThe total cash number is backward looking to ensure that creations andredemptions occur at NAV. When the fund is being traded throughout theday, the estimated cash amount is used to give the AP an idea of how muchcash the fund will require for the creation or redemptions. When calculatingthe IIV or an estimated NAV eNAV of an ETF, the estimated cash numbershould be used. This number takes into account potential dividends, management fees, and other potential cash and portfolio changes in the basket.Then the following day, when determining the exact requirements of cashmovement between the issuer and the AP, the total cash number is utilized.DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMSA common misperception that arises around the NAV is the discount andpremium calculations for a fund. The importance that investors place onthis number is a holdover habit from looking at the prevalence of premiumsand discounts in closedend funds CEFs. The two types of funds are listed,and the fund prices trade independently of NAV however, the premium anddiscount numbers are completely different in meaning. There are occasionswhere persistent premiums and discounts arise in ETFs, but that is due to astructural inconsistency. Typically any discount or premium pattern for anETF will be very shortlived as the arbitrage function enables its collapse inthe near term.A premium and discount reported on a CEF will typically be long termand reflect investor sentiment regarding performance expectations or otherstructural anomalies, whereas ETF discounts and premiums are temporary.I consider the reported discount and premium numbers based on NAV andthe market close price of ETFs to be marketplace noise. If you are executingan NAVbased trade on the underlying basket, then you will get the NAVP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONprice plus expenses regardless of whether the closing price of the ETF wasin line with that NAV.Under normal circumstances, the premium and discount that arises between an ETF NAV and its trading price at the end of the day is the resultof late market activity and will narrow on the following open. This is trueof ETFs with constituents that trade in the same time frame. We thoroughlydiscuss the details of international constituents in Chapter . But here it isrelevant to understand that those ETFs with international stocks in the underlying basket are essentially trading on expected valuations and can andgenerally do trade away from NAV. A premium or discount in those fundswould be a normal part of the price discovery process.Many circumstances can and will push an ETF away from its NAV atthe very end of the day, causing it to trade at either a premium or a discountcompared to the basket. It could be that a large order came into the ETFat the very end of the trading day too late, or too large, for the arbitragefunctionality. Additionally, as the trading day ends, spreads typically widento prevent the occurrence of exposures that will have to be held overnight.This can cause late prints in ETFs to be somewhat erratic and can create theimpression of a premium or discount versus the NAV.Avoid ing Discount or Premium Anomal iesMost discounts or premiums in U.S.listed ETFs with domestic constituentsoccur because of order flow that is less concerned with actual ETF value.When trading, you should try to avoid trading the ETF too close to themarket open, before the underlying constituents have all opened. While it isintuitive to wait until the domestic underlying constituents are open beforetrading the ETFs, it is also valuable to wait until the correlated hedge ofinternational ETFs start trading with full liquidity before trading those aswell. This should explain why you see spreads in many names tighten afew minutes after the open. Also, as the trading day draws to a close, ETFliquidity providers have the risk that they will not get completely filled ina basket and would have to carry overnight positions that are not perfectlyhedged. This is why spreads widen near the close. There is more risk toproviding liquidity at that time.If there are extraordinary circumstances in one of the constituents of theETF, then the fund can certainly trade out to a premium or discount. Perhaps a stock in the basket is halted at  p.m. This would not stop the ETFor the rest of the basket from continuing trading. When the NAV would becalculated at the end of the trading day, however, it probably would includethe last traded price of the halted stock. In this circumstance, it would makesense for the ETF to be trading at a price away from NAV because it shouldP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETFs with Domestic Constituents be trading with an expectation of where that stock will be trading when itnext reopens, as opposed to the price it was at when halted. There also havebeen circumstances in exchangetraded products where access to the underlying has been restricted for some reason. In one recent incident, an ETPwas forced to halt the creation function on the product because of holdingslimitations of the underlying securities. This would naturally cause the fundto move to a premium. This is easy to understand if you think about theliquidity provider typically prevalent in selling ETFs to buyers, pursuing anarbitrage against the underlying constituents. At the end of that trade, the liquidity provider typically would go about the process of creating ETF sharesto cover its short, flattening its position. If that process is unavailable, itloses the ability to unwind its short ETF versus long underlying position andtherefore would continue to tie up its balance sheet. Another caveat to thisexample is that if there are holding limitations of the underlying, the liquidityprovider would most likely need a proxy hedge as it too would be prohibitedfrom increasing holdings, even to hedge. That becomes a more expensive andriskier trade, and therefore it would want a higher price before making asale of the ETF. That higher price is not in absolute terms of the ETF but inrelative terms between the ETF and its underlying assets. Hence the premiumwould develop unless large sell pressure developed in the ETF itself.The characteristics of discounts and premiums are clear when you lookat them over time. Exhibits . to . show three examples of discount andpremium charts. Exhibit . represents the discount on a U.S domestic sectorETF. Because of the reasons just discussed and the inability to trade an ETFand the basket at exactly the same time at exactly the close, ETF prices generally close right around their implied value but not always on NAV exactly.The typical discount or premium will revert toward zero every day whenthe fund and the basket start trading simultaneously again. You can see inExhibit . that the discount and premium are almost always under .and are somewhat evenly distributed between premiums and discounts. Thisis the discount noise I mentioned that is the result of lateday trading.Exhibit . shows the discount and premium chart for an ETF that hasinternational underlying stocks that do not trade while the ETF is trading. Inthis case, the ETF is trading as a price discovery vehicle. The NAV of the fundis struck based on the closing price of the basket and a spot foreign exchangeFX rate, which adjusts throughout the U.S. trading day. The closing priceof the ETF at the end of the business day is then used as a comparison versusthe stock basket close some  hours previously. And again, just to clarify,that closing price of the ETF includes the days events and expectations forwhere the international market will open locally the next day. The pricinglag makes this discount premium chart relatively useless because it is notcomparing apples to apples.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeEXHIB IT .

The discountin the fund is large and fairly consistent, although the fund is composed ofa basket of SP  underlying stocks. Very few events will cause thatdiscount to narrow dramatically. The ETF price is tied to the NAV on adaily basis via the creation and redemption process, and this keeps the pricevacillating around NAV. There is no such tie to NAV for the CEF, leadingto a more persistent discount or premium.The CEF discounts are not always large discounts without any movement. In Exhibit . you can see the discount swings for a U.S.listed CEFwith a basket of international underlying stocks from India. You can seedrastic swings in the discount from deep discounts to large premiums andback again. Rather than being short term, however, they tend to last forweeks and months as opposed to closing daily. With the introduction ofETFs that track similar baskets of international underlying components, theopportunities to trade the CEF and the ETF as a pair attempting capturediscount and premium moves have increased.The discounts and premiums just described offer some slight insightsinto the respective funds. If you are looking at a CEF, for example, witha large discount, it is not necessarily cheap, as that discount may be aP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONEXHIB IT .

An ETF with international constituents trading ata  premium to its IIV may be considered rich by some but could also beconsidered cheap if it is late in the U.S. trading day and the market is up .If an order to buy , shares of a U.S. ETF with domestic constituentscame into the market at  pm and was filled at slightly above the basketvalue of the fund, you would potentially see a small premium number inthe fund. This does not necessarily mean there is more buy pressure for thefollowing day or that the fund is not working properly. It merely reflectssome lastminute activity in the fund that had an effect on price withouta correlating effect on the underlying basket. All of these discounts andpremiums are related to the fair value of the fund. Lets take a look at howto calculate that value.CALCULATING THE INTRADAY INDICATIVE VALUEAlthough the NAV is important for the calculation of prior endofdayvaluation statistics, the IOPV is critical for bringing you a step closer to theP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETFs with Domestic Constituents actual trading value of an ETF during the trading day. It is important todistinguish what this number actually is for two reasons. It goes by several different names.. At certain times during the day, it loses its relevancy because of tradinganomalies as discussed previously.The IOPV is also sometimes known as the intraday indicative valueIIV or the indicative net asset value iNAV. IIV is actually becoming themainstream name because this is the one used for quoting conventions. Theticker quoting convention is IV appended to the ticker for example, ETFIVor ETF.IV or ETF IV, depending on the system.I have also seen this number referred to as the underlying trading value, aterm that attempts to clarify what the number represents. What is important,no matter how you choose to refer to it, is that it is the number representingthe most recent trading value of the assets of a creation unit. This numberis designed to give investors and traders an almost realtime indication ofthe value of the assets underlying the ETF throughout the trading day. It isa tremendous idea that is unique to the structure of ETFs and is useful forETFs with underlying baskets of stocks that trade at the same time as theETF in the market. This number is typically published at a frequency of every seconds, which is why I call it almost real time. Some firms are starting tomake the number available to clients in realtime form. A lot can happen in seconds that makes the number more relevant as a guide than a mandate.If the funds price has moved slightly away, it probably would be a functionof delayed quoting frequency of the IV rather than an erratic movement inthe ETF price itself. This number is calculated from the creation unit that ispublished daily by the ETF issuers using the estimated cash in the portfolioon a pershare basis and the last price of the underlying holdings.The five steps for calculating the IIV are. Use the CU to get the proper share quantities for each stock in thebasket.. Multiply the last price of each stock by its representative share amountin the CU.. Sum the products to calculate total assets of the fund.. Divide this by the amount of shares per CU of the ETF.. Add to that the estimated cash value divided by the amount of sharesper CU of the ETF.IIV Shares per each component stock  Last PriceCU Shares Estimated CashCU Shares     FFOORR  SSAALLEE    EEXXCCHHAANNGGEE            wwwwww..ttrraaddiinnggssooffttwwaarreeccoolllleeccttiioonn..ccoomm             MMiirrrroorrss    wwwwww..ffoorreexxwwaarreezz..ccoomm   wwwwww..ttrraaddeerrssssooffttwwaarree..ccoomm wwwwww..ttrraaddiinnggssooffttwwaarreeddoowwnnllooaadd..ccoomm        JJooiinn  MMyy  MMaaiilliinngg  LLiisstt    P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONThe IIV is the implied value of the ETF as calculated by the most recenttrading prices of all the stocks in the basket. This value is calculated completely independently of the actual trading price of the ETF in the secondarymarketplace. However, in a U.S.listed ETF with a basket of domestic stocksunderlying, those two independently generated values should trade in paritywith one another because of the open conversion between the basket and theETF. This is one of the core functionalities of the creation and redemptionmechanism of the product wrapper and the one responsible for eliminatingdiscounts and premiums. In many highvolume ETFs, a quote for the IIVand a quote for the ETF should be at parity with each other. Differencescould be because of the time lag and other occasional structural nuances.Since stock and therefore ETF trading now takes place in microseconds,a lot can happen in between two separate second quotes. Professionaltraders are not using published IIVs as a basis for trading. Most, if not all,desks that are trading ETFs are calculating their own IIVs based on realtime quotes in the underlying baskets that they are generating within theirsystems. They will see their own IIV calculation in real time so they can acton pricing at the same frequency as their competitors. I can only imaginewhat would happen if I were a liquidity provider and I asked a client whowanted a risk market in an ETF to wait  seconds for the quotes to refresh.Most likely I would hear the click of them hanging up the phone.Latency in the Publ ished I IVThis brings up another point to understand about the IIV thatis published on ETFs. It is strictly a lastpricebased quote. Thestandardized published calculation of IIV is based on the mostrecent traded price of every stock in the underlying basket. However, this assumes that every stock in the basket is extremely liquid and hastraded within its most recently quoted market spread. Every stock has a bidand an ask price, the bid being the price that someone is willing to pay forthe stock and the ask price being the price at which someone is offering tosell. If a stock trades at  pm at  and the market in general rallies overthe next  minutes, but the stock does not trade, the new spread or the newlevels where people are bidding and offering the stock could be . bidand offered at .. But the IIV will be publishing a quote based on thelast traded price of . Because the trading community is using advancedsystems to price and trade ETFs, the market for the ETF probably will beshowing a level higher than the IIV quote. It is not a real premium it is justa function of latency in the IIV quoting structure. If you calculated a bidaskmarket for the IIV, you would see that the market for the ETF is basedaround where the market for the basket is now, not where it was trading atP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETFs with Domestic Constituents some time in the past. This also serves well to highlight the occurrence ofultrafastmoving quotes in the ETFs, which seems incongruous comparedto the slowermoving quotes in the published IIV. Most ETF spreads aregenerated by automated systems that are calculating the underlying basketsvalues in real time and are keeping their liquidity quotes around the basketat all times. If a basket has  stocks, probably the bid or ask of one ofthe stocks in that basket is changing, creating a constantly moving underlying value. The change of the underlying value causes an adjustment towhere the liquidity provider would buy or sell the ETF, so ETF quotes areconstantly being adjusted regardless of whether the actual ETF has traded.This is discussed further in the section regarding highfrequency trading inChapter .I am confident that as the popularity of ETFs continues to rise andbroadens beyond its initial institutionally dominated client base, the frequency of IIV quoting will increase to keep pace with the underlying marketplace. Thirdparty providers are developing more realtime versions ofthe IIV and beginning to distribute those numbers to users in various forms.This is not a technically difficult issue as much as it is a bandwidth expenseproblem.When I was actively trading, I sometimes was surprised that many ofmy large institutional clients used actual ETF price quotes as a proxy forfund values. This led clients to question why liquidity provider prices seemeddifferent from what the consolidated tape was showing at the time. Theydid not understand that the trading desk systems were working faster thanthe quotes on the exchanges at the time and had a better determination ofreal value than what was trading on the screens. I would be quoting pricesbased on where the basket was trading, representing the true ETF value thequote screens had not caught up with those prices yet. With the increasesin algorithmic trading, this situation has somewhat reversed in the mostliquid of ETFs. Because of their frequency of trading, they can now serve asvaluable proxies of value. This was not always the case.EXCEL EXAMPLEThe spreadsheet entitled Domestic ETF NAV IIV Model shows thecalculated NAV and IIV for a domestic equity ETF. You can see howthe basket and the required cash are interpolated into a basket marketand an ETF price.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONTRADING TIPSometimes it is more appropriate to use the IIV quote or the ETFmarket price for understanding true value. Here is a generic set ofguidelines for looking at ETF price versus IIVs. For very liquid ETFs. ETF market spread bidask and last tradedprice is a good market value determination point because of thefrequency of trading and the advanced systems of the participants. Lowvolume U.S.listed domestic ETFs. IIV is the best indicatoravailable for pricing with the understanding that it is based on thesecond lag. Typically the markets are very wide in these ETFs.You can piece together a decent valuation by looking at the IIVshowing your last traded price of the basket and where the currentspread is to get an idea of a proper valuation price. The last tradedprice in a lowvolume fund is not a good reference point for a neworder. Lowvolume U.S.listed international ETFs. For these funds youwould be best off using the market spread and an estimated IIVeNAV, which I discuss in detail in Chapter .CONCLUSIONIt is important to understand the different types of valuation mechanismsfor ETFs, the nuances of each, and how to use them to get the best executionon your ETF order. For U.S.listed ETFs with underlying constituents thatare trading at the same time as the fund, the IIV should be on or close to theETF price, and under normal circumstances premiums and discounts willbe arbitraged away. The IIV is a base of almost realtime valuation for theETF, which is unique to the ETF wrapper, as mutual funds and closedendfunds are priced either once a day or periodically throughout the month.In the next chapter we turn our attention to U.S.listed funds withinternational constituents. The information, however, will be relevant forany ETF with an underlying that is difficult to trade or is not trading at thesame time as the fund itself.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeCHAPTER ETFs with InternationalConstituentsM any of the same valuation concepts of exchangetraded funds ETFswith domestic constituents apply to ETFs with international underlyingstocks as well. The main differences are functions of the timing and thecurrencies. If the underlying constituents trade in a time zone different fromthe ETF, the intraday indicative value IIV will remain constant for theequity portion but will change based on a relative spot foreign exchange FXrate. In this chapter I cover the concepts of calculating net asset value NAVand IIV of international equity funds. I look at ETFs with internationalconstituents in terms of what their prices mean to the markets and the effectthey may have on global exposures within investor portfolios.ETFs available with international underlying products are seen in thegrid in Exhibit .. These products represent approximately  of the ETFuniverse by AUM in the United States as of September , .This chapter will go over the calculation of NAV, IIV, and the estimatedNAV eNAV for ETFs with international constituents. For U.S. investorsseeking to diversify their portfolios by investing abroad, these funds areincredibly important. U.S. investors can now access investments that coverbroad regions, such as emerging market smallcap stocks or specific countries, such as India or Japan. However, because of their diverse underlyingcomponents the funds present an additional valuation challenge to the ETFunderstanding what the price in the market is saying. They also bring theadditional risks of timing differences and currency exposure. By the end ofthis chapter you will be able to interpret whether the market price of an ETFwith international constituents is rich or cheap and what that might meanfor trading the funds.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONEXHIB IT .

The calculation is done usingthe creation unit and the total cash and the amount of sharesof the ETF represented by the creation unit. In addition, there is a currencyconversion to bring the price back to U.S. dollars USD because the ETF islisted and quoted in dollars.NAV Shares per each component stock Last PriceCurrency RateCU Shares Total CashCU SharesNote This is for currency rates in divisible form e.g., at the time thischapter was written, the number of yen per U.S. dollar equals ., sowhen you sum up the products of shares multiplied by price in yen, youthen need to divide that number by the currency rate to convert it to a USDfigure. Also, the currency rate for the NAV is struck at a specified andstandard time every day. This is different from the spot rate that is used forthe calculation of IIV, which is discussed later in the chapter.Currency Considerat ionsWhen calculating the NAV of an ETF with international constituents, there isa currency conversion to bring the NAV price into dollars. Because the ETF isP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETFs with International Constituents listed in U.S. dollars on a U.S. exchange, here and in the calculation of IIV thepricing of the assets is converted to dollars. The assets themselves, however,are held in local currency, and there is no actual currency trading done by thefund for the purpose of valuing the assets. The exception is trades done bythe fund to account for corporate action changes, the conversion to dollars ofdividends and other cash payments potentially received or paid by the fund.But in general, since the funds take in and disburse assets via the creationredemption process, which in most cases involves the inkind delivery andreceipt of shares, no currency transactions are necessary. The shares arereceived in and delivered out in their local currency and the ETF shares aredelivered and received in USD. The issuers provide the timing of the standardrate used for currency conversions when calculating NAV. Although theissuers are not doing currency transactions in relation to asset changes, thebrokerage community does have to transact in foreign currencies.Internat ional ETF Execut ion Example Lets look at the case of a U.S. customer wishing to receive an NAV execution in a U.S. ETF with Japaneseconstituents. These are the steps for the facilitation. The customer gives an Authorized Participant AP an order to buy million notional of ETFINTL a U.S.listed ETF with Japanese constituents at the official NAV.. The AP buys the basket of Japanese constituents at or as closely aspossible to the close of trading the following day in Japan.. In order for the AP to buy the basket of Japanese shares, it has to borrowyen to pay for the stocks.. The AP then delivers that basket of stocks to the issuers agent andreceives the ETF.. The AP then delivers the ETF to the client, receiving U.S. dollars aspayment.. The AP is now flat in equityETF positions but has an upanddownposition in currencies. It is long U.S. dollars, having received them fromthe customer, and short yen, having borrowed yen to cover its purchasesof Japanese stocks. It will buy yen with the U.S. dollars to repay the loanand flatten its currency position.The FX transaction of the AP is important because it will determinethe price of the ETF to the customer. The customer will receive the USDETF based on executions of Japanese underlying constituents, USDYENexecution, and cash per creation unit. The official NAV of the ETF usesa standard accounting practice to determine the FX rate while a customertransacting through the underlying will receive a value based on an actualP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONFX execution. The AP will want to do its currency transaction at the sametime as the fund so there is minimal price differential in the pricing betweenthe customer and the ETF.Timing of Creat ions and Redempt ionsAn important difference between funds with domestic or international underlying constituents is the timing of NAVbased trades. If you are lookingfor an NAVbased price on a fund with domestic constituents, you will beable to place an order during the ETFs market hours and receive a fill onthat order during the same trading day. If it is an order benchmarked to theofficial NAV of the fund, you will receive an ETF price that is equal to theclosing price of the stocks in the basket plus the cash in the fund, all pricedas of the same day. This is impossible in an ETF with constituents tradingin a different time zone. In this case your pricing will probably be basedon nextday execution. Lets use Japan again as an example to describe thisprocess and compare it to a domestic ETF.Comparing a Domest ic and Internat ional Execut ion Starting with the U.S.fund, the time frame of order placement and execution would be as follows. During the U.S. trading day subject to various timing restrictions, placeorder with an AP to buy  million notional of ETFUS at NAV.. Before the close on the same day, the AP will send a market on closeMOC order in each of the constituent stocks.. Just after the market close, a report will be issued based on the closingprice of the stocks in the basket and the estimated cash in the ETF.The following day an adjustment will be made to account for the smalldifference between total cash in the fund and the estimated cash numberpublished previously.Now lets look at an example of the timing of a similar purchase of million notional of ETFINTL at NAV, which has a basket of Japaneseconstituents. In theory, anytime before the close of trading in Japan, a customer canplace an order with an AP to buy  million notional of US listed ETFINTL at NAV. Note that if you are interested in an NAVbased price ofthe ETF with Japanese constituents, you should not be limited to U.S.trading hours for placement of that order, since because of the timingyou are not actually trading during the U.S. market session. If you makethe decision to buy today at  pm, for example, the order will not beexecuted until the market on close in Japan on the next Japanese tradingP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETFs with International Constituents day. It is beyond the scope of this book to go into specific global marketregulations on closing price calculation methodologies you must discussthat with your broker in advance.. The AP will place the order to buy in Japan based on local MOCregulations.. On the U.S trading day that follows the close in Japan, you will receivethe execution price based on the closing stock prices in Japan and thetotal cash in the fund.TRADING TIPFund issuers place restrictions on creation and redemption times onAPs to facilitate processing of those orders. These timing restrictionsare essentially for the APs and are actually less relevant for the clientin terms of executing flow. If you can contact an APs internationaltrading desk and give an order in an ETF for it to execute using theinternational basket, in many cases it will be able to handle it regardlessof what the times were for creations and redemptions. On the backend, to facilitate the flow, it will end up with a long or short ETFposition and the corresponding basket position the desk will then usethe creation and redemption process to clean it off their books.When trading a fund with international constituents from multiple countries in an NAVbased transaction, you will be subject to the various closingtimes on the following trading day. The funds prospectus will list the timingconvention of the pricing of the currency. Remember that a U.S.listed ETFbased on international underlyings has inherent FX exposure. This meansthat even if the prices on all the stocks in the underlying basket do notmove, and the currency moves between your purchase and sale dates, thenthe USD price of the ETF will move. You will have either a profit or loss onthe position.Transacting in various international underlyings will expose you to local regulations and potentially added costs. In some of the more regulatedinternational markets, the ETF may have certain restrictions on timing ofcreations and redemptions and the ability to source local liquidity. Also,within the NAVrelated price of the international ETF, there might be embedded fees, such as stamp taxes and additional broker costs, which the APmust recoup for transacting in those local markets. Be aware that these extrafees will also show up in the ETF spread while it trades during U.S. hours. Allof these expenses and nuances are built into the ETF spreads that liquidityP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONproviders make. For instance, liquidity providers that are using the creationand redemption mechanism to do types of arbitrage or source liquidity in theunderlying basket will have to pay these fees. They will then reflect them inthe pricing of their spreads. It is important when pursuing executions basedon NAV in internationalbased ETFs to speak in detail with the executingbroker to understand all the various charges that will be involved and thetiming of the transactions.TRADING TIPIf you want to hedge the FX exposure and just isolate your performanceto the stock moves, you can either do an opposing FX transaction oruse the currency ETFs for hedging or better tailoring your position.That is a benefit of the existence of currency ETFs. They give youthe ability to potentially hedge out your currency exposures in aninternationalbased ETF by isolating the stock price moves. This wouldbe done from the long side with a long position in the ETF withinternational constituents and short the respective currency ETF inthe notional amount of the exposure. Alternatively, you can isolateyour international exposure to the currency itself by just positioning inthe currency ETF without any exposure to actual underlying equities.For example, if you are long an ETF with Japanese local constituents,you are inherently long yen exposure versus the USD. If the dollarstrengthens against the yen, the U.S.listed ETF will lose value in dollarterms even when the underlying equity prices do not move. To hedgeagainst such FX exposure and thereby isolate the equity or currencyexposure, a long holder of the ETF would either sell yen in the spotFX market or sell one of the available currency ETFs. If, however, youare just buying the fund to achieve some expected performance in thecurrency, you can just purchase the currency ETF directly, isolatingyour position away from any equity exposure. There will be differentconcerns and advantages to using each method.Intraday Ind icat ive Value and the Est imated NAVUnderstanding the intraday value of a U.S.listed ETF with international constituents is somewhat more complicated than itsU.S.based counterparts. The timing of when the basket is trading and the fact that it is not trading at the same time as theP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETFs with International Constituents ETF is makes it far more complicated to value. It is critical to understandthat a U.S.listed ETF with international constituents is trading in the market as a price discovery vehicle. It is acting as a mechanism that estimateswhere the underlying basket will be trading when it begins trading at thelocal market open. This is quite different from a U.S.based ETF, whichis almost always trading in line with its underlying basket. Thus international ETFs will usually trade at a premium or discount to their IIV because there is no arbitrage mechanism available if the underlying marketsare closed. The price is trading independently from that of the underlyingconstituents.Based on the timing, the published NAV of an international fund inthe United States will be seen on a oneday lag on most systems. Keepingwith Japan as our example, last nights trading in Japan is not reflectedin the NAV for a Japanese ETF that is published today. The NAV for theETF will be officially published at the end of the U.S. trading day with theU.S.listed ETFs. The IIV for that same fund, however, will be based onthe most recent trading activity in the market. So the IIV on a fund withJapanese constituents in the U.S. morning will be based on trading activityin Japan that occurred during the trading day. This information is valuablefor pricing the ETF only before the trading in the United States begins andas a basis for pricing the ETF during the U.S. trading day. It shows wherethe basket traded at the close of business in Japan, but significant eventssince then may now be influencing the price of the ETF. There is no realtime arbitrage available between the ETF and its underlying basket duringthe hours the ETF trades, so the two prices will move independently of eachother and most likely during different time zones. One will be representingthe most recent close while one will be representing expectations for thenext mornings open.TRADING TIPWhat causes the IIV of an ETF with international constituents to moveduring the U.S. trading dayUnlike the NAV, which has a fixed currency rate for the conversion,the IIV does not. The currency rates are moving constantly, and theIIV is reflecting changes in those rates as they apply to the underlyingbasket. During the U.S. trading day, the IIV calculation is showingwhere the basket of international stocks most recently tradedclosedconverted to dollars at the currency spot rate.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONThe best way to determine what would be a proper valuation for anETF with international constituents that is trading in the U.S. market wouldbe to make an estimation of sentiment and market movements at the time oftrading based on some proxy assets. I call this the calculation of estimatednet asset value eNAV. Estimated NAVs have been used to value closedendfunds CEFs for many years prior to the invention of the ETF. EstimatedNAVs attempt to estimate what factors would have an effect on the value ofthe underlying basket and build those factors into a new price estimation ofthe basket itself. This used to be important in the CEF world because onlyweekly or even less frequent NAVs were published. If you knew where thebasket was on Friday and it was Wednesday, in order to have an idea ofwhere the right value for the CEF was, you would want to create an estimatedchange value to apply to the last known NAV. That would be the generationof an eNAV value. It is interesting that you can purchase eNAV values forCEFs, but currently no providers are selling them on ETFs for consumptionby the investment community. This limits eNAV availability to the playerswith the resources to build the systems to calculate those estimating factors.At the moment the client base is mostly using market pricing to evaluateETF prices, which is dependent on other participants valuations.There is currently an arms race in the process of calculating eNAVbecause it enables traders to price larger blocks of ETFs on risk into themarketplace, capturing order flow, commissions, and spreads in the process. This causes trading volumes to expand because there are so manydifferent variables and combinations of events that can affect any one setof international constituents. There is no standard valuation for the eNAVthe process is subjective, and those differences of opinion are what makeinternational ETFs valuable as estimates of future pricing.A basic formula for calculating an eNAVeNAV Shares per each component stock Last Local PriceFX rate   xCreation Unit Shares Estimated CashCreation Unit Shareswhere x  the expected percentage change in the underlying constituents.In this formula, the variable x will be generated based on some set ofcorrelating proxy assets. Also note that this formula is using estimated cashbecause it is attempting to formulate the realtime approximation of thevalue of the ETF. There is rarely a need to estimate actual NAV becauseit will be published on a backwardlooking basis using the closing pricesP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETFs with International Constituents of the constituents and the total cash. When creating an eNAV for theapproximation of fund value, you would use the estimated cash in the fund,which would approximate what would be required in doing a creation orredemption at the next available time.EXCEL EXAMPLEThe spreadsheet entitled International ETF NAV IIV Model showsthe calculated NAV and IIV for a U.S.listed ETF with Indian localconstituents. You can see how the basket and the required cash areconverted and interpolated into a basket market and an ETF price.PROVID ING LIQUID ITYThe process of making markets, or providing liquidity, in an ETF in whichthe underlying is not trading at the same time as the ETF is very differentfrom doing so for the domestic version. In the example where the customer isa large buyer of the Japanese ETF, the liquidity provider will then sell the ETFto the customer. At that point, the liquidity provider LP will be pursuingone of two goals either purchasing shares of the ETF back in the marketsat a cheaper price, or purchasing some predesignated hedge for its position.In a situation where the ETF and the basket trade simultaneously, the LPwould buy the basket to be perfectly hedged. This situation is representedin Exhibit ..At a later point, the LP would potentially create the shares in the ETF,flattening its position and clearing its balance sheet.In this case, the basket is not trading simultaneously with the ETF, andthe LP is going to rely on the eNAV and the correlated hedge to reduce itsexposure. Even with a great hedge, however, the process of unwinding theLong CreationUnit PositionShort ETFPositionPerfectly Hedged,No Market ExposureEXHIB IT .

International ETFCorrelating Hedged PositionThe ETF and correlated hedge cannot be collapsed.position is not as simple as creating the ETF at the next opportunity. In thisexample the LP has sold the ETF to the customer and put on a position thatcorrelates to the ETF and trades during the same trading hours as the ETF.This can be seen in Exhibit ..Unlike in the domestic position, this position cannot be flattened via thecreation and redemption mechanism. If the LP decided to do a creation ofthe ETF to try to unwind its short position, it would just end up with a shortposition in the creation unit, as can be seen in Exhibit ..Since the creation and redemption mechanisms are based on the inkindtransfer of one asset for a basket of other assets, they represent the sameexposures. Since the correlating hedge is not the creation basket, the positionis not flattened via the creation and redemption mechanism. This processcan be utilized to gain access or switch positions between the ETF and theunderlying basket if that is a more advantageous position.There are some exceptions to these situations with the most prevalentbeing the cash creation and redemption of certain ETFs. In certain circumstances the AP is able to deliver or receive cash in exchange for receiving ordelivering the ETF. This can be the case if the country of origin underlyingthe ETF has restricted trading privileges. In this situation, the LP could beselling the ETF and buying a correlating hedge during the day, and then atthe end of the trading day it could potentially unwind its hedge and takethe risk between our market close and the close of market in the respectivecountry. At that point, the LP would do a creation in the ETF, deliveringcash and receiving ETF shares to cover its short position. This can be donein a variety of ways and is really a function of trading in the various markets.It is no longer pure arbitrage between an ETF and its underlying basket.Long CorrelatingHedge PositionShort CreationUnit PositionHedged, Limited Market Exposurefrom Slippage but Not FungibleEXHIB IT . International ETFAfter the CreationAfter doing a creation of the ETF, you are left short the basket versus the hedge.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETFs with International Constituents The combination of the variability of an eNAV calculation, the confluence of many different users, and the arbitrage mechanism of the ETF structure have combined to help make some of the internationalbased ETFs verypopular products within the trading and investment community. Comparedto the arbitrage mechanism in ETFs with domestic constituents where themain drivers are speed and financing, ETFs with international constituentsrequire global systems and a sense for trading. A firm will be willing to goonly so far on the faith in its automated correlation hedge before it is nolonger willing to take risk. In the market dislocation of late ,there were tremendous opportunities in ETFs that traders were able to pursue and benefit from. All the while they were providing liquidity in theETF wrapper and bringing the discounts and premiums back into line whenpossible.Note about Premiums and DiscountsPremiums and discounts in relation to IIV of an international ETF are a veryvaluable tool for understanding what might be happening in the markets.They generally are the result of the underlying basket being closed, so thepricing includes speculation on where that basket will be at the open ofthe next trading session. Thus, in relation to CEF premiums and discounts,which typically are longer term and involve more than shortterm marketperceptions, international ETF premiums and discounts can represent a potential additional opportunity or even an added cost to trading. If you wantto buy ETFINTL based on Japanese underlying stocks and that ETF is trading at a  premium to its IIV because of some positive news event, youcan either pay that premium during the U.S. trading hours or wait until theJapanese markets open and have a LP source the ETF liquidity from theunderlying constituents. If the underlying stocks only open  higher thanwhere they closed and you can buy your basket, you were able to save versus the estimate of where those stocks were expected to open. When youare executing via the local underlying shares, you are trading at the impliedNAV price of the ETF, avoiding any movements based on sentiment andnews. In a sense there is no correct price for ETFs with closed constituentsthey are trading without a true fair value reference point. The spreads thatare present in the market include the risk that LPs are taking in terms oftheir correlation hedge breaking down before they are unable to unwindthe position. As an investor, in order to avoid paying for that risk and alsoto avoid paying for possibly faulty market expectations, it is best to try toexecute order flow utilizing the baskets when possible. Building your ownprice and valuation model and trading at your calculated limits is also agood method for achieving execution.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONCONCLUSIONInternational ETFs are moving swiftly along the volume and asset growthcurves. They have been in the markets for a long time but there is still an opportunity for further evolution. Although many different types of investorshave become more comfortable with this product and find more uses for it,more issuers are finding ways to launch products based on niche underlyingsthat are continually opening up the world to ETF investors.International ETFs are giving investors the ability to achieve exposuresin different countries, regions, and sectors prior to their markets opening, in a more efficient and liquid environment than any previously listedinvestment products. These ETFs are giving investors easy exposure to areas that previously could not be accessed, such as some emerging marketcountries that typically require investor identification and local registration,along with prefunded trading and advanced clearing agreements. This hasopened a whole new world up to both international asset managers andretail investors alike.Another added benefit of these listed international ETFs is their uniqueand transparent structure, which allows liquidity providers to define risks,giving them the ability to hedge, even if with a proxy vehicle. Just as optionspricing mechanisms added a quantifiable dimension to option trading, ETFshave similarly changed international trading. Their structure allows LPs tocommit more capital and make larger risk markets on international exposures during the U.S. trading day, which is being supported by an explosionof volumes and investor assets. Volumes have become so expansive in someproducts that spreads and size available surpass that typically available inthe underlying market.The equitybased ETFs are far and away the largest category of ETFassets. Every player in the investing world is now utilizing these productswhere applicable in their portfolio. And the ideas for new coverage areasand new ways to use the products are expanding daily. Throughout theremaining chapters in Part Two we explore the many other types of productsthat are becoming available in the world of exchangetraded products. It wasimportant to focus on valuing the equity products first because they are thebasis for many of the products we will encounter, whether they are currencyor fixed income or commodity based. And the basic tenets of calculating thevalues of the ETFs for trading and execution purposes are consistent withwhat we have discussed in this chapter.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeCHAPTER FixedIncome and Currency ETFsE xchangetraded funds ETFs were firmly entrenched in the investing landscape by the early s. They developed a strong following in the hedgefund and institutional communities as a costefficient way to access a broadrange of exposures and to hedge portfolios and manage cash.Regulatory delays held back the launch of the first fixedincome ETFsin the United States until . The initial fixedincome products met withreasonable success in the marketplace. As SEC restrictions have eased, thearray of products has grown dramatically. There had already been strongdemand for fixedincome products in the closedend fund wrapper. Fixedincome ETFs are growing rapidly to compete against those products andcreate another alternative to mutual funds.The growth of the currency ETF market has followed a similar pathin that regulatory hurdles have had a significant impact on the productsavailable. The first U.S.listed currency ETPs did not reach the market until. In fact, because of regulatory hurdles, the initial currency productswere grantor trusts and partnerships. These products are not investmentcompanies and therefore avoided the lengthy SEC review. ETFs coveringcurrencies did not make their debut on U.S. exchanges until . Thesuccess of some of those products will be a test of structure over firstmoveradvantage. As I mention at other points in the book, firstmover advantagehas always proven to be very strong in the exchangetraded product ETPmarket. Typically there has to be some true differentiating factor for afund to succeed where another fund is already present offering a similarexposure. It could be a different fee range or diversity of underlying or someother differentiating factor. In the case of the currency ETFs focused ondeveloped market countries, structure ETF, Grantor Trust, and Note isthe differentiating factor. Only time will tell if the investing public deemsone structure to be better than the others. Currency ETFs offering exposureto emerging market currencies were launched within months of comparablealternatives and also offer distinct structural differences.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONWhile fixedincome and currency products came late to the ETF party,their growth has been notable in the milestones achieved in so short atime frame. The rapid growth in the fixedincome funds has attracted theattention of some major liquidity providers and institutional investors, whichcurrently are developing trading strategies and technologies to get moreinvolved in this asset class. Exhibit . lists the important developments infixedincome and currency ETFs.The fixedincome and currency funds as a group make up only about of the overall assets in the ETF universe as of January . That is overwhelmingly dominated by fixedincome funds. The currency fundsas a group currently compose only a small fraction of overall ETP assets.I would attribute this to their late entrance to the ETF world and to thesomewhat heavier educational requirements of the product suites. Currencies in particular do not traditionally have the heavy retaildominated clientbase that has been driving a lot of the growth of the ETF industry recently.Continuing to educate investors about the benefits of noncorrelating assetclasses and the uses of currency products alongside or instead of foreignequities will help those product sets to grow over time. The initial currencyproducts focused on the most widely traded currencies outside the U.S. dollar, typically referred to as G currencies. The newer products are helpinginvestors access a broader universe of currencies, including emerging markets, and achieve more of an investment theme in their currency exposures.Exhibit . shows the number of funds and assets currently available in thefixedincome and currency categories.EXHIB IT .

We take a look at the difficulties of calculating the intraday indicative value IIV in the fixedincome funds and the unique requirements of wrapping a fixedincome product into an equitystyle wrapper. Wethen switch over to the currency products and look at the characteristicsof the various structures available. We look at how those exposures areachieved and how they trade.As two of the largest asset classes in the global investing arena, thereis a tremendous amount of potential growth for fixedincome and currencyETFs. They are very new to the ETF wrapper and have only just begun todevelop their potential. A long list of products is scheduled to launch inthese categories over the next year, and I expect that the assets will continueto grow significantly.F IXED INCOMEThe fixedincome market had been in the sights of ETF issuers for manyyears before they were launched. The race to launch the first fixedincomeETF pitted Barclays Global Investors against a small startup, ETF Advisors.After years of development, the initial launch of four ETFs under the iSharesbrand included three Treasury ETFs and one ETF comprised of investmentgrade corporate bonds. ETF Advisors followed a few months later with fourTreasury products focusing on key Treasury benchmark securities. As hasbeen mentioned, the first mover is always in an advantageous position inthe ETF world, and eventually ETF Advisors succumbed to its late arrivalin the market and liquidated its ETFs in .When a generic listing standard for ETFs was passed, the time frame tolaunch new funds shrank dramatically. Many of the fund filings had beenP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONwith the SEC for years. Sponsors adapted the traditional inkind creationand redemption process to address the unique needs of various fixedincomesectors.With the exception of the corporate fund, the initial fixedincome ETFsall incorporated representative sampling and optimization in tracking theirbenchmark with duration being the leading consideration. There were onlysix fixedincome ETF listings from  to . But more than  fixedincome ETFs have been launched in the two years that followed.Lets take a look at some key differences in the ways that the fixedincome and currency markets function in comparison to the equity markets.They embody many of the obstacles that these funds have to overcome whenlisting in an equitystyle wrapper.Key Di f ferences in the F ixed Income MarketsPric ing Is Di f ferent Fixedincome markets are overthecounter markets.There is no official open or close and no exchangebased official pricing center. Trading desks price their own portfolios of bonds at the close by pollingmultiple sources to determine a fair valuation. Mutual funds often rely onseveral sources for final valuation. If you ask multiple market participantsfor the closing price on a particular year Fannie Mae note, for example,you can potentially get several different yet close answers. The variabilityof marked prices for a given bond as well as the spread between bid andask prices is inversely related to the liquidity of the bond. Ontherun Treasuries are some of the most liquid securities in the world. They will showlimited variability in closing prices between vendors and feature minusculebidask spreads. A highyield corporate bond, however, that trades infrequently will have estimated values that could differ greatly between pricingvenues.This overthecounter structure and lack of official pricing initially madeit difficult to build ETFs around. ETFs typically require final closing pricesto generate the net asset value NAV, similar to a mutual fund, but alsoneed an intraday estimate on the value of the fund IIV. Product designerswere forced to adapt to a dramatically different world without exchangepricing.Bonds Are Not l ike Stocks Common stocks represent a percent of ownership of a public company, and the value fluctuates with the supply anddemand on the transparent exchanges. Bonds are debt instruments with aninterest rate component, set stated maturity, and unique payout structure.One issuer can have several different types of bonds with varying components and varying values. The prices are set by the pricing source the traderP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeFixedIncome and Currency ETFs chooses, and the trader does not have the benefit of the consolidated tapethe equity market provides.Unlike shares of common stocks, no boilerplate structure or valuationmethod applies across the wide variety of bond sectors. Treasuries, corporate, mortgagebacked, and municipals and other fixedincome sectors allface unique risk factors. Interest rate risk is a common factor to all fixedincome securities, but sensitivity levels differ wildly. Specialization amongthe fixedincome sector is common and almost essential in the trading andinvesting arena.Market Sizes Are Di f ferent One of the starkest differences between thefixedincome and the equity markets is the typical size of a trade. Thefixedincome markets are dominated by the institutional trading communitywhose sizes are generally large and in round lots. The market participantsare not used to or set up to facilitate the smalllot trading sizes that mightbe required in an ETF creation or redemption.The beauty of the ETF structure is its ability to bring this mostly institutional trading arena to the smaller institutions and individual investors.The creation units of fixedincome and currency funds try to bridge the gapbetween the large players in the underlying markets and the smaller playersin the ETF markets by shrinking the balance needed to provide liquidity.There is a delicate balancing act among issuers trying to keep the creationunit size small, investors wanting a broadbased exposure to a sector, andthe fixedincome and currency markets not being extremely accommodatingto smallsize trades. Creation unit size is very important in ETFs for helpingclients to achieve liquidity in the products. If the size of a creation unit isvery large in a fund, it is hard for liquidity providers LPs because they willhave potentially large residual positions on their balance sheet. Keeping thecreation unit size small enables LPs to clean up residual positions via thecreation and redemption mechanism. The oddlot trades within a typicalequity basket are not an issue because of the traditional smalllot sizeprevalent in that marketplace. The oddlot bond and currency positionsthat can be generated from the creation and redemption mechanism are acompletely new animal in the fixedincome and currency worlds. Beyondsimple market differences are those of the traders and other marketparticipants.Bui ld ing a Trading Bridge Fixedincome arbitrage has been described ashedge fund and fixedincome proprietary desks picking up nickels in front ofsteamrollers. The larger bid and ask spreads and the occasional noticeablepremiums and discounts that occur on many of the fixedincome ETFs wouldP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONsuggest that currently many of those nickels are getting flattened. This isbecause of the fundamental differences between stocks and bonds and fittingone asset class into the wrapper of another.Fixedincome and currency ETFs are basically equitized derivatives ofthe underlying alternate asset class. The final product fits nicely into theplatform of investors, but trading and hedging the individual componentshas created a steep learning curve for the community of ETF LPs. Several ofthe differences between the asset class trading communities act to highlightwhy these ETFs trade so differently in the marketplace ETF trading desks are typically equity traders. The ETF trading community largely grew out of the equity derivatives desks of AuthorizedParticipants APs and specialist communities. Only a few of the tradingprofessionals have a strong fixedincome background. ETF traders are from Mars, fixedincome and currency traders are fromVenus. The rapid growth in product variability offered in the ETF marketplace has presented an interesting situation for the standard APs.The ETF desks primarily have equity backbones, and they are now involved with products that ordinarily trade in very separate and distinctareas of their firms. It was not uncommon just a few years ago at thelarge investment banks to have minimal or no interaction between theETFequity traders and their counterparts in fixedincome and foreignexchange FX. Now client demands make collaboration a necessity.Divisions had to come together to coordinate hedging and means ofproviding liquidity across asset classes. If arrangements within a firmcould not be made, LPs have sourced the functionality from competingfirms in order to facilitate flow in the products. Equity systems do not typically handle bonds. Many ETF trading desksoperate using systems designed for equities. Many fixedincome portfolios and currency positions are tracked and hedged using applicationsspecifically designed to handle their nuances. Robust systems reduceoperational risk and foster greater conviction in trading and thus liquidity. The growth of the products is driving a rampup in technologyneeded on the ETF desks to handle multiple asset classes and an enormous amount of underlying products for hedging and risk managementpurposes. Additionally, many of the available fixedincome ETFs utilizeinkind creation and redemption baskets. Properly trading fixedincomeETFs starts not only with building a model to estimate the IIV but alsosecuring reliable pricing sources to feed that model. So while investordemand continues to develop in the ETF wrapper of this asset class, sodoes the LPs ability to handle its nuances.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeFixedIncome and Currency ETFs TRADING TIPIt is interesting that ETF traders have branched into the fixedincomeand currency worlds and are utilizing their new access to make moneybetween the ETFs and the underlying market. However, I have notseen a lot of crossover where currency traders and fixedincome marketparticipants are watching the ETFs that cover their respective productsand attempting to arbitrage away any spread that might appear. Asthe industry matures I would expect more multiproduct trading tohappen and there to be a merging of the typically diverse systems usedto trade the multiple products. It would only be natural, as volumesand sizes pick up, for fixedincome and currency traders to trade andmanage risk in the ETF markets. This would bring further liquidity intothe markets and tighten spreads, benefiting end investors. Currently,however, there are still sometimes opportunities for traders in thesefunds because of potential market inefficiencies.I IV and NAV Pric ing Sources There can be a high degree of variability inthe trading frequency for certain bonds. Some bonds, such as Treasuries,trade frequently while other bonds, such as corporates, may trade onlyoccasionally. This is an understandable attribute in the fixedincome worldbut somewhat unacceptable in the ETF world. In order to account for thefact that an ETF has to publish a daily NAV, matrix pricing has becomethe common method in ETF bond pricing. Matrix pricing is a method ofvaluing bonds using historical relationships and prices to estimate a currentvalue for similar bonds. Matrix pricing groups bonds that have similar riskcharacteristics and prices them in a similar fashion.A variant of matrix pricing is also incorporated into the intraday pricingof the IIV for many fixedincome categories. For municipals and corporatebonds, spread relationships to London Interbank Offered Rate LIBORoften drive the algorithms until fresh market data can be incorporated.In times of high market volatility, the level at which investors andtraders would consider transacting in the underlying bond of an ETFcan deviate significantly from the last trade data, indicative levels, or thematrix pricing approximation that is incorporated into the IIV. Duringthe fall of , complications with estimations of LIBOR, the basis forintraday pricing of many creditspecific ETFs, created an unforeseen level ofuncertainty. While there was some shortterm deviation from the underlyingP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONvalues in the fixedincome ETFs, the return to more normal volatility levelshas dampened these divergences. This is not a function of the arbitragemechanism failing but a function of a lack of true liquidity and pricingtransparency in the underlying baskets. Assembling inkind fixedincomebaskets, particularly more sensitive credit investments, often involves highercosts for ETF trading desks. In the overthecounter market of fixedincomeand FX, the ETFs based on less liquid underlying constituents are actuallytaking on the role of price discovery for their underlying assets. The pricingof the ETF as it is trading in the market can be used as a combination ofthe most recent valuation and sentiment of the underlying products thatdo not have a realtime price. This is somewhat similar to the function ofETFs with international constituents, which convey the market sentimentof markets that are closed. In this case, however, the ETF price will bediscovering valuations of an underlying basket of less liquid securities.CURRENCY ETFsOverall, currency products make up a very small portion of the ETF universe.As opposed to the commodity products, where there is currently one outstanding favorite product with a concentration of assets and many smallerperiphery issues, the currency product assets are more evenly distributed.Out of the available  products in  categories,  have assets greaterthan  million in the various funds offering exposures in that category.You can see the details of where the assets are in Exhibit ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RUBZARNZDICRMXPSEKGBRLCYBGBPUSDGCHFCADYENAUDEUREXHIB IT . Currency ETF Assets Combining Assets of Various Structureswith Similar ExposuresSource Bloomberg. As of .P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeFixedIncome and Currency ETFs Structure of Currency ProductsThe first currency products came to the market in  in the grantor truststructure, and the ETF structure was not launched into the marketplace until . The currency ETFs are issued as registered investment companiesRICs and are registered under the Investment Company Act of . Asregistered investment companies, these funds have added flexibility in managing their underlying investments to shape their riskreturn profiles. Thesefunds have the protections characteristic of funds structured as registeredinvestment companies, including Diversified credit risk Limitations on leverage and lending Oversight of a board of directors Assets that are segregated and maintained with a qualified custodianIt is interesting to note that the currency ETFs came to the market underthe actively managed fund exemption because they are not tracking indexeseven though they are attempting to provide reasonably passive exposure tocurrency movements and nonU.S. money market rates. The benefits to thisactive management exemption are mostly in operational efficiency withinthe structure. Given their flexibility, the funds can alter their investmentapproach in delivering the desired exposure to shareholders. The FXmarkets are among the most liquid in the world, but access to locallydenominated money market instruments and spot exchange rates differsbetween various regions. In a few developed markets, the currency ETFstake a direct approach, as they invest directly into locally denominatedmoney market investments. As can be seen in Exhibit ., this is a distinctivestructural feature available for taxable investors in ETFs versus the earliergrantor trust products.Only a few countries have local money markets with the combinationof issuer breadth, development, and accessibility necessary for this directapproach to structuring funds. The currency ETFs providing exposure toless accessible markets utilize currency forward contracts combined withU.S. cashtype investments to manage and achieve their exposures. Thiscombination produces a riskreturn profile that is economically similar tothat of a locally denominated money market instrument. In nearly all ofthe markets for which the ETFs use this approach, trading volume in FXis high enough to support product growth. Because of the liquidity of theunderlying portfolios, which combine emerging market currencies with U.S.cashtype products, these ETFs typically feature bidask spreads narrowerthan many creditspecific fixedincome ETFs.

I mention severaltimes that structure is going to be the new battleground where productscompete with similar exposures. Nowhere is this more apparent than in theP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeFixedIncome and Currency ETFs currency products landscape. A look at some of the characteristics of thevarious currency structures available is shown in Exhibit ..Nuances of the Currency Markets Currencies trade  hours a day, butthe volume in particular currencies is typically concentrated around the local market hours and trading times at the nearest of the three main tradinghubs Asia Tokyo, Singapore, and Hong Kong, Europe London, and theAmericas New York. Although futures exist on many currencies, the bulkof FX transactions occur in the overthecounter interbank markets throughspot transactions, forward transactions, and swaps. Tullett Prebon GroupInc., ICAP, and the WM Company provide commonly followed fixing times,but nearly every brokerdealer also provides fixing prices at other designatedtimes. Realtime quotes are becoming increasingly available via Bloombergand Reuters data services. For example, Bloomberg produces realtime composite quotes, while Tullett Prebon Group and others have realtime feeds forcontracts on currencies available via Reuters and Bloomberg. The less liquidand less accessible the currency, the greater will be the variability in pricing.The general point is the fact that the currency market is an overthecountermarketplace with varying times of liquidity and accessibility. The ETP issuerhas the challenge of defining an IIV and creating an investment strategy usingthe currency and money market instruments to best serve the end investor.I IV and NAV Pric ingThe main aspect of calculating the value in the currency funds is convertingthe assets in the fund into U.S. dollars because they are traded on a U.S.exchange in dollars. For a fund that holds either foreign currencies or moneymarket contracts denominated in local currencies, you would calculate theirvalue in dollars, add to that the value of any U.S. cash products, subtractother fees and expenses, and divide that by the shares outstanding to get toa value for the fund.The main difference between the IIV and the NAV is going to be thetime of the exchange rate conversion. Since there are no underlying equities,there are no closing prices that need to be converted. The NAV will usea standardized time and provider for the exchange rate conversion. Whencalculating the IIV, you would utilize the most recent spot rate or market inthe underlying derivatives.If you are looking at the funds in the grantor trust ETV structure, youwould. Convert the underlying currency holdings into U.S. dollars.. Add and subtract the relative accruals and fees.. Divide by the number of shares outstanding.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONIf you are looking at the currency ETFs, which invest directly into locallydenominated money market instruments, you would. Calculate the value of the underlying holdings in local currencycontracts.. Add the current profit and loss on the underlying derivatives.. Convert this value into U.S. dollars at the current spot rate.. Add or subtract the value of any relative accruals or other expenses andfees.. Divide by the number of shares outstanding.EXCEL EXAMPLEThe spreadsheets entitled ETF Currency Products and Grantor TrustCurrency Products show the calculated NAV and IIV for currencyproducts. They also show the calculations necessary for interpolatingthe ETF prices into the currency rates.If you are looking at the currency ETFs that utilize forward contracts,you would. Calculate the value of the underlying investments in U.S. money marketinstruments, primarily government securities.. Calculate the value of the currency contracts.. Add the current profit and loss on the derivatives.. Add or subtract the value of any accruals or other expenses and fees.. Divide by the number of shares outstanding.Some practitioners opt to focus primarily on the spot exchange rates invaluing the funds investing in local money markets, or the currency forwardcontracts in monitoring the funds that follow less accessible currencies.Structural Arbitrage There are euro and Japanese yen currency productsin both the ETF and ETV structure. This creates potential arbitrage opportunities between the two if there is a mispricing in one or both products.There are also differing tax treatments and slightly different managementfees that open up some other potential trading opportunities. Trading desksaround the Street are still trying to develop crossasset class systems andP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeFixedIncome and Currency ETFs alliances to better take advantage of these opportunities as well as providemore liquidity.TRADING TIPIf possible, align trading of the currency ETP with peaks in trading volume for particular currencies. This is when bidask spreads will be attheir tightest. Trading in developed market currencies is active throughout any hour period. The volume in Asian currencies except forJapan is more based around Asian trading hours, but relatively tightbidask spreads on the underlying components are still available in theU.S. morning. European and Asian currency trading in general slowsdramatically after the London close in the late morning, New Yorktime. Latin American currencies remain active through much of U.S.equity trading hours.CONCLUSIONIt is difficult to log a detailed view of fixedincome and currency ETFs intobook form because the product set is evolving very rapidly at the moment.Several new entrants are gearing up to become competitors in the fixedincome space. I would expect that we will see a tremendous amount of assetgrowth in those products over the next decade. This will benefit the neweradvisory and retailbased client base converting portfolios over to the ETFstructure. As the use of these products expands in personal accounts andk plans, the fixedincome and currency categories will enter a stage ofvery high demand.In the currency world, there is a whole new asset class for investingthat has previously been hard to access for individual investors and advisors managing assets. Several new methods of accessing global currenciesare converting to formats that are available to the investing public. Alongwith currency ETPs, there are ways to access some global currency markets via foreign bank accounts and electronic brokerage accounts. But forthe investing public, I think currencies wrapped into the ETF structure willsit nicely within the broader portfolios and provide convenience as well aslowmaintenance exposure.The ETF structure, initially on equity products only, has taken a giantleap into alternate asset classes. It is trying to provide investors with easyP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONaccess to fixed income and currencies with the convenience of an equitywrapper that can be traded simply in a brokerage account. This leap ofinnovation is challenging the market participants to connect the equity divisions to all other trading divisions and share market knowledge, tradingsystems, and risk management systems. This challenge is being met withenthusiasm and gusto, but it will take time for these products to trade asefficiently as their equity brethren.This is definitely the area I will be watching for expansion as investorappetite and familiarity, as well as liquidity provider coordination, catchup to what these products bring to the table. In Chapter  we exploresome products that are even farther from the realm of traditional portfolioholdings. The leveraged and commodity product sets are changing the wayinvestors look at portfolio management. We delve into the details of theproducts looking at many of their various nuances.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeCHAPTER Leveraged, Inverse, andCommodity ProductsT he leveraged, inverse, and commodity groups of funds have recently beenreceived tremendous media attention. The reason for this is that theyhave quickly become very popular products for use in the statistical arbitrageand investing communities. The products are very attractive for shorttermtactical strategies and for use as shortterm hedges without the need to rollfutures. According to a recent report on leveraged products, LeveragedETFs represent only . of the ETF market by market cap, yet they haveaccounted for roughly  of the dollar volume and   ofthe share volume of the ETF market over the past several months.The commodity funds have brought the individual investor access toboth hard and soft commodities. Many of these products were never previously available for portfolio allocations on such a broad scale and areleading to changes in the way they are applied in the development of bothlarge and small investment portfolios.As of early January , the combined assets of the commodity andleveraged products made up about  of overall U.S.listed exchangetraded fund ETF assets. Exhibit . shows the breakdown of the funds inthese categories, in terms of assets and number of available funds.The basic mechanisms for calculating net asset value NAV and intraday indicative value IIV and valuing these funds on a daily basis are similarto what was described in Chapters  and . In this chapter we discuss significant differences between these ETFs and examine performance and otherdistinguishing characteristics of these exciting asset categories.INTRODUCTION TO LEVERAGED PRODUCTSFor advisors and independent investors, the ability to obtain leverage viaequity products without using margin is very enticing.

In the ETF marketplace, products available today are structuredmore to satisfy the former, by providing daily leverage on a wide variety ofunderlying categories.Understanding what the term daily leverage means will help you usethe products correctly to achieve your goals. The products are structuredwith the aim of providing two times, or even three times, leveraged dailyperformance, as compared to their underlying index. If the index is up today, your performance in the ETF should be up  today. It is not easyto build leverage into a structure that trades on an intraday basis. In orderfor the product to achieve the desired multiple of performance versus theunderlying on a daily basis, the products have to be reset to  exposureon the close of every trading day. What that means is that the leverageperformance applies only to dayoverday price movements, not to the basisat which you entered into the trade. You are not guaranteed that multipleof performance versus the benchmark over a longer period of time. In thisunique product design, the portfolio is essentially marked to market everynight. It starts with a clean slate the next day, almost as if the previous dayhad not existed. This process produces daily leverage results. However, overtime, the compounding of this reset can potentially vary the performance ofthe fund versus its underlying benchmark. This can result in either greateror lesser degrees of final leverage over individual holding periods.All major research providers produce a tremendous amount of researchon the ETF marketplace. They have all written detailed pieces on how theseproducts work and the various effects of the leverage factors. I present asimplistic view of the subject in the hopes of making it more easily understood by the broad market. Leveraged products can play a very valuablepart in a portfolio if they are approached with a proper understanding ofthe potential return results. Those results are a function of closely examiningthe product structure to understand what the potential holding performancecan be and how that compares to your investment intentions.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeLeveraged, Inverse, and Commodity Products I focus specifically on two important attributes of these products thedaily compounding and how it results in performance variation, and thepotential ramifications of the rebalancing activity pursued by fund providersto maintain their leverage factors.Compounding of ReturnsDaily compounding of leveraged long ETFs can result in increasing percentage gains in rising markets and decreasing percentage drops as markets aretrending lower. If an index is rising for several days in a row, the trending movement is very important, as that will translate into ETF growth ata faster pace as the value of the index is increasing. For a long leveragedproduct, it will outperform its expected goals in a rising market and willunderperform its expected goals in a falling market.In Exhibit . we can see the data grid for a market that is rising at each day for  days in a row. The index and the doubleleveraged ETFtracking that index both started out at . As the market rose  on day, the index also rose  to , and the ETF rose two times  to .On the second day, from this new higher base the index rises another ,resulting in a gain of  of  to . At the same time, the twotimesleveraged ETF will produce a gain of  on its new base of  to .The ETF is producing returns from a higher base after the first days gain.You can see that every day the ETF is producing its anticipated return ofEXHIB IT .

In essence, the ETF is doingwhat it is supposed to do produce results that equal two times the dailyperformance of the index. However, because of an increasing price, thosegains are driving the value higher at a faster pace. On the bottom of thegrid, I show the day percentage returns on both the index and the ETF.It would be incorrect to expect the day return of the ETF to be twice thatof the underlying index because of the compounding as just described. In amarket that is trending up because of daily compounding, you achieved areturn of much greater than twice the index return.Exhibit . shows the returns over the period graphically to presenta visual understanding of what that performance will look like. You canclearly see the performance spread widening between the two benchmarks.In Exhibits . and . you can see the grid and graphic depicting theopposite event. In this situation the market is declining at  per day for days straight. At certain points in late  and early , it felt as ifthat might actually be occurring! In this example, as the index drops from to , producing a  move of  points, on day  the down move willbe  and only  points. The daily compounding of the leveraged ETFswill magnify this effect. While the ETF will be achieving a negative move on a daily basis over the longerterm horizon, the compounding willresult in a much less significant move downward than two times the indexdrop. In this example, with the index down  over the day period,the ETF is down only  percent because it was losing progressively lessin notional points every day.

They demonstrate how thereis a pathdependent function of leveraged ETF returns that will have a directeffect on their longterm return results.

So an important risk to consider with.......Expected Index Level Expected ETF LevelEXHIB IT . Flat and Volatile ChartMarket Up  and Then Down  for DaysP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeLeveraged, Inverse, and Commodity Products these products is that you have to be correct on your market direction andyour timing. You will need both to be correct to help position you whentrends begin. These examples do not include slippage of the ETF versus itsdaily performance goal because of the use of derivatives beyond the use ofthe swaps, taxes, and other expenses.Performance Fl ip Something else that can occur when a market is experiencing high volatility is referred to as a flip. A flip occurs when the returnsin a leveraged ETF are the opposite of what they should be based on thereturns of the underlying index. As an example, the investor has a positionin a twotimesleveraged long ETF tracking the Standard  Poors SP index. If the index at the end of the measured time period has achieveda gain, the investor might expect the leveraged long ETF to report resultsthat are close to two times that gain. However, it must be remembered thatbecause of compounding, the results over time respond in a pathdependentfashion and results are a function of market volatility. At the end of the measured time period, if the ETF is reporting a net loss in terms of performance,that would be considered a flip with regard to return results.Dai ly Reset to Provide Constant LeverageIn order for the leveraged funds to achieve appropriate levels of assets sothey can provide their implied leverage, they have to rebalance daily. Theyleverage up their exposure to assets to provide the desired returns. In thecase of an ETF providing long twotimes leveraged exposure, they wouldtypically attain exposure to a notional of assets of two times their NAV. Anexample would be an ETF that takes in  units in assets that does a swapwith a counterparty to provide exposure to  units in performing assets.The rebalancing activity of these funds will almost always be in the samedirection as the market.Lets walk through an example of the required hedging activity for along leveraged ETF. The initial index level in our example is  on day ,as can be seen in Exhibit .. In order for the ETF to achieve the twotimesmove versus the index, it would need exposure to assets equal to . If theindex falls from  to  on day  a  drop, the ETFs NAV shoulddrop to , while the exposure of the underlying assets also drops ,to . At this point, however, with the NAV at , the ETF only needsexposure to assets worth  to provide its required twotimes exposure onthe following day. This will facilitate the need for the fund manager to sell units of assets to bring the underlying exposure to .The result would be the same in an ETF providing leveraged shortexposure. In Exhibit . you can see the results from a oneday move inP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONEXHIB IT . OneDay Asset Change Results for Leveraged Longand Short ETFsLeveraged Long ETF Market Dropx Leveraged Assets ProducingDay Index Long ETF Returns      Leveraged Short ETF Market Dropx Leveraged Assets ProducingDay Index Short ETF Returns      both a leveraged long and leveraged short ETF. The leveraged short ETF, inorder to bring the levels of assets to the required short  to generate twotimes returns for the  level, would have to short an additional  unitsof assets within the exposure vehicle.There is a transaction cost to this daily rebalancing. There are potentialnegative tax implications, and there are the physical costs of trading theunderlying notional amounts on a daily basis. Because much of the exposureis achieved via swaps, and the funds hold Treasurylike investment vehicles,some of those costs will be offset by the interest income generated.UNDERSTANDING INVERSE ETFsThe leveraged and inverse categories typically are combined primarily because like leveraged products, inverse ETFs use gearing to provide theirexpected returns. In the case of a normal inverse ETF, the gearing ratio willbe , whereas with a leveraged short fund the gearing might be  or even times. There are many more leveraged short products than products thatprovide inverse exposure. The inverse funds exhibit the same traits as theleveraged funds in terms of compounding and rebalancing, but those effectsare muted because of the low gearing in the products. The effects are alsodependent on volatility and will increase and decrease proportionally.Essentially, like leveraged products, these funds hold swaps to achievetheir exposure. A short SP  fund would hold a swap, paying thereturns of the index to the counterparty. If the index trades up on any givenP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeLeveraged, Inverse, and Commodity Products day, the ETF would have to pay returns on the index to the counterparty,causing the value of the ETF to decrease. If the index trades down, the ETFwould be receiving the return of the index, thus driving its NAV higher onthe day.In order to achieve the daily return of the index on a rolling basis, thefunds will reset their holdings daily in the same manner as the leveragedproducts. This procedure was discussed in the previous section in this chapter. Inverse funds bring an important tool to the investing community in theform of long negative exposure. The next section discusses the implicationsthis type of exposure brings to product trading and liquidity.Trading and L iqu id i tyYou can trade and access liquidity using inverse ETFs in the same manner asany other ETF. If you are a buyer of the inverse SP fund, for example, youcan buy it in the market electronically or you can go to a liquidity providerfor an NAVbased execution or for them to provide you with a largeblockmarket. In this scenario, the liquidity provider LP would be shorting theinverse SP fund to you, so they effectively would have long exposure tothe SP . In order to hedge itself, the LP would have to sell some formof correlating exposure, either the basket, futures, or another derivative tooffset the long exposure. This is opposite the scenario of the LP selling alongbased ETF to a client.Some important factors about the inverse ETF should be understoodwhen trading them. They are a great way to achieve downside market protection in accounts that typically cannot achieve that type of access, such asIndividual Retirement Accounts. You can buy a product that will increase invalue as the market declines. This opens up an entirely new way to positionyour portfolio. Formerly, longonlytype investors had the opportunity tohave long market exposure or cash now they can take advantage of, or protect against, expected down moves in the market. This could have a profoundeffect on the way people manage their investment portfolios in the future.Another characteristic of inverse products is the changes in their exposure. For those who were able to short listed products previously, theseproducts offer a way to short the market without the risk of unlimitedlosses. When you short a stock or ETF in the market, you are exposed tothat position going potentially infinitely higher. Your portfolio could suffer devastating losses. When using an inverse ETF, the losses are limited tothe amount that you invested into the position. When you are correct inyour positioning, howeverwhen you are using an inverse ETF and yourunderlying exposure is going downyour exposure to that position is alsoincreasing. As the market is moving lower, your ETF NAV should be movingP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONhigher, increasing your notional exposure to the position, if the cumulativedirection is correct. This is the opposite effect of a typical short position inwhich your notional exposure decreases as the market moves lower.COMMODITY ETVsOver the last few years, growth in the commodity ETVs has been astounding.Various structures are providing exposure to an asset class that had beendifficult to access for many investors. Within the category you can obtainbroad or narrow exposures to single commodities or baskets of commodities.Some products are even attempting to actively manage baskets of variouscommodities based on different strategic trading models and various factors.The products fall into three main categories of commodities. Agriculture. Energy. MetalsBut within these categories are many variations of products offeringdifferent combinations of exposures. ETVs use several methods for providingexposure to commodities. These include holding The physical commodity Futures tracking a single commodity Futures tracking baskets of commodities Equities with exposures to commodities in various formsThe funds holding various baskets of equities will be exactly like anyother Investment Company Act of  ETF with either domestic or international holdings. They utilize various weighting schemes to provide exposuresvia equities to companies that have commodityrelated activities.FuturesBased FundsBeyond the equitybased funds are funds that utilize futures, swaps, or otherderivatives to attain their desired exposures. There are two effects to considerwhen using commodity funds with futures as the underlying. The potential effects of position limits due to either the notional size offund holdings or regulatory concerns. The potential effects of rolling those futures positionsThe expanding size of futuresbased funds and their size relative to theunderlying markets that they track led to a market review, in the summer ofP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeLeveraged, Inverse, and Commodity Products , by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC about theirpotential influences within the commodities markets.Example of What Can Happen in a FutureBased ETF During the summerof , the natural gas ETF temporarily halted creations, which limited theissuance of new shares. This happened initially not because of any concernsregarding the funds size but because of its need to increase its number ofshares available to be sold. Because the fund has holdings of futures orother derivatives, it acts like a commodities pool rather than a typical Act ETF. A vehicle in which many investor assets are combined and tradefutures contracts as a single entity in order to gain leverage is considereda commodity pool. This type of fund registers a specific amount of sharesto be issued and then has to formally request an increase if it needs toexpand further. In many cases this is a problem of being overly successful.Although new share issuance was approved, the fund did not immediatelyrestart the creation process because of the fund management companiesconcerns regarding potential future position limit rulings from the CFTC.At the time of this writing, the management has adopted a waitandseeperspective on any regulatory changes before restarting the issuance of newfund shares. This has caused the funds price to rise relative to its NAV. Whenan ETF halts, even temporarily, creating or redeeming shares, it assumes thepremium and discount trading characteristics of a closedend fund. Theshare price will diverge from the underlying NAV based on forces of supplyand demand. In the case of an ETF limiting creations, the fund price shouldtheoretically move out to a premium. That is exactly what occurred.Several potential demand factors are driving this premium. Natural demand for the fund shares could drive fund prices higher relative to the NAV.Market makers would build in the costs of financing a position that couldnot be collapsed via the normal creation process while providing liquidityto the market. Additionally, there would be added demand from liquidityproviders to borrow shares to cover the short positions occurring becauseof the lack of new share issuance. On top of these two related drivers isthe new entrance of arbitrage players attempting to make money on thespread between the fund and its NAV. Arbitrage players could potentiallypursue two actions. If they view that this will end quickly with new positionlimits, arbitrage players would want to short the ETF because of its premium and buy the underlying futures contracts. Shorting the ETF becomesdifficult because the stock borrow gets used up quickly, and even the sellpressure from the shorts does not drive the price to NAV. The contrary viewis that the CFTC will limit the amount of contracts available to the funds,causing them to have to reduce the amount of shares outstanding. This canpotentially drive the premium much higher than its current level. If the funddecides to restart creations, the real arbitrage between the ETF shares andP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come EXCHANGETRADED FUND VALUATIONthe underlying futures positions will cause the premium to narrow quickly.Right now, with a premium reflecting demand for ETF shares, there is abenefit to owning shares of the ETF this benefit would be reflected in a highrate of stock loan rebate paid to long holders for loaning out the ETF shares.Although this seems like a shortterm trade while awaiting a decision, if theCFTC decides to permanently limit fund holdings, the shares could trade ata premium for an extended time.A commodities futures contract is a standardized contract to buy or sella commodity at a specific date in the future based on a price agreed to today.Important to note is that futures have an expiration date at which point thecontracts expire then you have to deliver either the underlying asset orcash, depending on the specific futures contract you have positioned. A fundholding futures will have to roll those positions at every expiration date.This is necessary so that the fund does not lose its exposure to its underlyingasset class. In order to roll your futures position, you would have to sell thecontract you hold called the nearmonth contract that is about to expireand buy the nextperiod contract that is available the farmonth contract.Because of this periodic selling of the near contracts and buying of the farcontracts, futuresbased funds sometimes can be subject to the effects ofbackwardation or contango.Backwardation is a condition in the futures market where the futurecontract price is lower than the spot price, which is essentially the value ofthe expiring near contract. The opposite condition is contango, where thefutures contract price is higher than the spot price. These two conditions ofthe marketplace can cause performance variations in the ETF NAV relativeto its benchmark. It is important to look closely at what the funds are doingand read each prospectus. It is important to know how funds handle theseconditions in the futures markets and what effects they possibly can have onthe funds performance.Physica l Commodit iesThe biggest fund in the commodities realm is the SPDR Gold Trust. At theend of August , this fund held more than  billion in assets reflectedas a holding of approximately  million ounces of gold. This representedmore than  of all assets in commodity ETFs at the time.Storage costs are probably the most important consideration of the ETFsthat hold physical commodities. It is relatively easy to hold gold bullion ascompared to similar notional amounts of natural gas, which is why certainfunds are based around derivatives and others are not.The physical commodity funds in general are reasonably easy to value.On the Web page of the Gold Trust, for example, you can see the actualP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeLeveraged, Inverse, and Commodity Products holdings of ounces of gold and the number of shares outstanding on a dailybasis. When calculating the value of the fund, you would calculate a realtime value for the gold held by multiplying the number of ounces by themost recent midprice of gold bullion. Then you would divide that numberby the number of shares outstanding. This would give you a value beforeexpenses of the gold in the trust in share terms.An important facet to understand when investing in the commodityfunds is taxation. In the case of the Gold Trust, gold is treated as a collectiblefor longterm capital gains purposes. If held for more than a year, individualswill be subject to a capital gains rate of . According to the Gold TrustWeb site, it also received a private letter ruling permitting investment byretirement plans. This is not tax advice it is important to determine yourown situation regarding taxes through discussions with your accountant.CONCLUSIONThere is a need to understand any product in which you invest and itspotential investment risks. Although leveraged and inverse ETFs do providea very important and functional tool, how they are utilized is critical to yourend investment performance. Distinguishing your investment goals and timehorizons and understanding what potential market activity can do to theperformance of your portfolio is extremely important.Commodity and leveraged products, in many cases, are far from having the transparent and easytounderstand structure of a  Act ETF.However, these products can be very valuable in an investment portfoliowhen properly understood. There is a wealth of information available onthe Web sites of the various issuers and a tremendous amount of researchand analysis provided by the industry for investors.A lot of what we have discussed in terms of valuation of funds throughout Part Two of this book can be interpolated into the valuation of thesefunds. However, depending on whether they hold futures, physical commodities, or swaps will add additional twists that will need to be considered.The concepts remain the same. Products with underlying assets that tradeat the same time as the fund are subject to immediate arbitrage trading.Products with baskets that are difficult to trade or are domiciled in a different time zone will lead to price discovery valuation during the U.S. tradingday. In Part Three we look at the trading volumes of ETFs, how they aretraded, and best methods for execution, and we discuss the various marketparticipants and several of their trading strategies.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to ComePARTThreeETF Tradingand ExecutionO ne of the most touted benefits of the exchangetraded fund ETF structure is the fact that the funds are listed on exchanges and can be tradedthroughout the day. This is a huge benefit for those making intraday tradingdecisions. For a longerterm investor, however, the fact that you can tradeinto and out of an ETF at net asset value NAV becomes its most importantcharacteristic and puts it on equal footing with competing products. Theadditional benefit of being able to exit the position midday, without waitingfor a closing NAV, adds an amount of liquidity and potential risk reductionto every portfolio. Having both avenues available in one product is provingto be a gamechanging technology as is evidenced by asset growth over thelast decade. Part Three discusses the details of how and when participantscan take advantage of the underlying liquidity of ETFs.Part Two of The ETF Handbook revealed the internal mechanics and thevaluation techniques of the ETF structure. You now know how to interpretthe price of a fund when you are getting ready to trade. You can assesswhether it is trading in line with its valuation. Understanding the underlyingvalue of the fund you are planning on positioning means you are able tomake important decisions about execution times and strategies. Once thatvaluation is determined, you need to understand the people with whom youwill be interacting when trading ETFs and some strategies for executing ETForder flow.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONPart Three explains What ETF volumes mean Chapter  What the money flows look like in an ETF trade Chapter  The ETF trading model Chapter  Practices for best execution in ETFs Chapter  Examples of large and small ETF trades being executed in the marketplace, including discussion on the interaction of the different playersand how the liquidity was achieved Chapter  Who are the most frequent traders of ETFs and what businesses theyare engaged in Chapter  Who provides liquidity and who typically takes it Chapter It is quite simple to take a small order in one of the most popular ETFsand get it executed.

Bywatching ETF quotes representing baskets, you can clearly see groupsof stocks trade and how they are moving in relation to similar groups oftheir peers. This is changing the way stocks are valued in the marketplace.It used to take advanced systems to see the performance of various differentsectors in the markets. Now, for example, you can watch an ETF coveringa U.S. sector and see how it is trading versus one covering a similar butinternational sector. You can use this trading comparison to judge hownews is being interpreted on a global basis.ETFs and stocks are very similar in that they are both treated as equityproducts by stock exchanges. As such, both are subject to many of the sametrading rules regarding equities trading. One of the main distinguishing characteristics of ETFs was their exemption from the uptick rule for shortingstocks. Their success with this structural nuance paved the way for all U.S.stocks to enjoy the same benefits in the last few years.In actual product structure, however, ETFs have some internal mechanics that make them very different from a typical equity product. Themost glaring is the fact that ETFs have what is called continuous issuanceof shares via the creation and redemption mechanism. This feature enables rapid expansion or redemption of shares outstanding in an ETFand is the main facilitating feature that has enabled ETF volumes and assets to grow. It is this creation and redemption functionality that unlocksall of the underlying liquidity in an ETF, making it accessible to everyinvestor.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONIn this chapter we discuss The main similarities and differences between stocks and ETFs How the liquidity of an ETF is based on both trading volume andunderlying basket volume The landscape of current ETF volumesIn this chapter and throughout Part Three, we go into the details ofwho the participants are in the marketplace and how participants can takeadvantage of available liquidity in ETFs via the exchanges or underlyingbaskets. Volume and liquidity are the keys to the ETF world. Understandingthat you can utilize an ETF that trades infrequently in the market by accessing its underlying basket enables you to expand your personal productuniverse. This will give you tools to expand portfolio access and managerisk that were previously unavailable.HOW IS AN ETF DIFFERENT FROM A STOCKOne of the main differences that I like to highlight between howETFs and stocks trade is the typical counterparty. I considerthe typical stock trade as two opposing viewpoints meeting inthe marketplace. A bullish viewpoint and a bearish viewpointcome together at a similar price point, enabling a trade to occur.An ETF trade is different. A large proportion of ETF trades take placebetween a bullish or bearish viewpoint and a liquidity provider. An investorwants to buy or sell. Instead of buying from another investor with an opposing viewpoint, the investor typically is trading versus a liquidity provider.An ETF acts like a derivative whereby its value is derived by an underlyingbasket of securities. A position in the ETF can then be hedged by utilizingthe underlying, thereby reducing the potential risk to a liquidity provider.This trading versus a liquidity provider is especially true of many of thelowervolume ETFs.This is where the lead market maker LMM and other liquidityproviders can add the most value. In the veryhighvolume ETFs, there areso many arbitrage participants continually competing with evertighteningspreads to squeeze out any potential margins that actual LMMs are notcritical to the daily order flow, so they become a smaller percentage of thevolume in the market. You can see the inverse correlation between LMMparticipation rates and ETF volume by looking at the statistics available onthe New York Stock Exchange NYSE Arcavision data service. Alternatively, in the newer, typically lowervolume ETFs, the LMM is important,P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to ComeTrading Volumes and ETF Liquidity playing the role of product caretaker, helping these products to grow byproviding opposing liquidity against client order flow. In many cases, thereis an opportunity for a liquidity provider to take the other side of an ETFtrade, achieving two simultaneous goals. Satisfying customer demand to buy or sell the ETF. Taking advantage of a spread between the price at which the ETFtrade takes place and the price at which the basket or hedge can beexecutedThis has been beneficial for the ETF business because issuers are ableto launch products and liquidity providers and LMMs are able to takethe other side of the ETF order flow to facilitate initial trading, achieving both goals simultaneously. This is primarily achieved via the creationand redemption mechanism embedded in the ETF structure, which hasproven to be most important compared to traditional equity and competingstructures.The beauty of the arbitrage mechanism in the ETF is that it hascreated an entirely new ecosystem for trading in the markets. Whereas inthe past there were only about five equity indexes on which you couldpursue arbitrage opportunities between baskets and the futures, now thereare hundreds of arbitrage opportunities between baskets and ETFs. Theability to trade baskets of stocks as separate individual equities or as aunit has created arbitrage revenue streams previously available only tothe index arbitrage trading desks in a limited fashion. As more and moreindexes are created and ETFs are issued on those indexes as replicationvehicles, the opportunities to take advantage of arbitrage spreads has grownas well.A BRIEF LOOK AT EQUITY TRADING VOLUMESExhibit . presents a grid showing stock listings by volume tradingbuckets. The universe is composed of products trading on NYSE Arca butnot including ETFs and closedend funds CEFs. There is a reasonablynormal distribution of volumes in relation to listed equities. A full  oflisted products traded between , and ,, shares per day onaverage over the last three months. The listing of stocks on exchanges isan established business and is considered to be mature. The ETF marketis still in its infancy. There have been many products issued recently thatare attempting to take advantage of this new structure.

Months Average Daily Trading Volume.A DETAILED LOOK AT ETF TRADING VOLUMESThere is always a lot of heated debate about the average daily tradingvolumes of ETFs. I have heard arguments saying that the extremely highvolumes generated by people pursuing arbitrage opportunities in ETFs arebad for the investing community. And I have heard arguments saying thatthe low trading volumes in ETFs are an indication of faulty product development. I do not agree with either of those arguments. I believe that highertrading volumes are beneficial for everyone because of the increased liquidity that all participants can take advantage of for their own purposes. And,since lowvolume ETFs are still in a structure that can handle rapid swings involume and rapid changes in fund size, their average daily trading volumesdo not indicate either fund success or product development problems. AsI explained earlier in the book, there is a long history of some ETFs existingin the market for an extended period before attaining a notable amount ofEXHIB IT .

With the added expenses of listing funds now as compared to severalyears ago, fund companies may no longer have the luxury of extended waittimes for smaller products.In part, the debate arises from the fact that many of the initial ETFswere tracking indexes with long histories and massive amounts of moneyalready using them as a benchmark. This has led to a belief that all ETFsneed to have huge trading volumes as a testament to their success. This isactually an incorrect way to view the product structure. The newer ETFsutilize their more advanced structure to compete in a different arena. Manyof the fundamentally weighted ETFs, for example, are investment vehiclesmeant to compete with the CEF and mutual fund families. They are notdesigned as trading vehicles, and while they can be used for shorting, theyusually would not work well as a hedging vehicle. They are attempting to gobeyond pure beta exposure. Instead of offering indexreplicating exposures,they are attempting via a compendium of methods to outperform thoseindexes and everything else that may be using them as a benchmark.In many ways, these newer products have created a class of listed mutualfunds, which offer the benefits of the new structure while also embodyingthe benefits of the old. In this context, using their trading volume to judgethem is inconclusive because the idea is for them to be used by the investmentcommunity. The beauty of the ETF structure is that, with its many differenttypes and uses, it can be attractive to all sorts of investors, from fastmoneyaccounts thriving on high volumes to the buyandhold accounts that donot trade frequently. The target audience should be taken into accountwhen discussing viability, along with other analyses into the liquidity ofunderlying and assets under management AUM.Lets take a look at the average daily trading volumes of ETFs listedin the United States shown in Exhibit ..

I use volume buckets because they give you a range thatmakes sense in terms of actual trading liquidity by product, not includingunderlying liquidity from baskets. I think that there is little difference inexchangebased liquidity between a product in the lessthan,sharesbucket and one in the ,to,sharesperday bucket. Any ofthese ETFs would require care when trading by most participants I havebroken them out to highlight the large group of ETFs that reside in thatlowestvolume bucket.In Exhibit ., you can see that more than  of the ETFs listed inthe United States currently trade less than , shares per day. You canalso see in the box directly underneath that those ETFs control a mere of the assets in the market. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a mere of the ETFs listed in the United States control approximately  ofthe assets, and those ETFs trade more than  million shares per day each.This product line is clearly undergoing a rapid growth spurt and will likelyexperience a smoothing out of the assets and volume curves over time.I view the bucket containing ETFs with an average daily volume in the,tomillion range as the transition zone. This may explain whythere are very few funds in this range. Typically the goals for volume froman issuer standpoint start with the first stage to get volume above ,shares per day. Then stage  would be to get the volume above the ,sharesperday range. Once a product starts trading comfortably over thatrange, additional trading firms and investors come in, taking the product toover  million shares daily in a short time span. This is reasonably easy totest as a theory, and I will be sure to include time frames of that range in thesecond edition of this handbook. It is important to remember here that I donot consider daily trading volume to be a valid consideration for positioningunless you are pursuing a highfrequency or trading strategy. The furtherout your investment horizons extend, the less value trading volume shouldhave in your investment decisions. With a longerterm horizon, you arebetter off executing via some form of NAVtype execution, which we discussin detail in Chapter . And this will make any trading volume numberlargely irrelevant because you will be having an AP utilize the creation andredemption procedure for your execution.Exhibit . offers expanded views of the same data, showing the numberof funds separated out by issuer in each volume bucket.

This is the cold hard data on trading volumes. Itdoes not take into account potential liquidity available from the baskets, andit does not show growth trends. It is a static moment depicting the previousthree months of trading volumes and a pointintime asset number. Someimportant conclusions can be gleaned from all the data Looking at the percentages of each issuers suite by volume bucketsshows that lowvolume funds are present in every suite of products invarying degrees. There are a lot of products in the market that do not have high tradingvolumes. There is room on the trading side to grow the facilitation business inlowvolume funds to aid in utilization in a large group of availableproducts. These products have been brought into the marketplace andin most cases have a sufficient amount of underlying liquidity that is noteasily accessible by the investing client base. Although there is a large increase in new users of the ETF structure,they are not pushing large amounts of assets yet into the more esotericstructures, as shown by the asset concentration in a very small groupof funds. This can change with increased trading abilities and increasededucation about using ETFs.ETF MONEY FLOWSThe assets under management of an ETF are the representation of how muchmoney is in a fund. This number can change rapidly. The market movementof the underlying basket and the creation and redemption activity changethe AUM of the fund on a daily basis.The actual trading volume of an ETF does not have a direct effect on theAUM. An ETF can trade a tremendous amount of shares in a given day, butif that trading does not lead to net creations or redemptions, then the AUMcan remain constant. Take the example of an ETF arbitrage firm selling aparticular ETF all day and buying baskets against it to hedge. In this example,the buyer of the ETF shares was another ETF arbitrage firm that was buyingthe ETF and selling the basket. At the end of the day, the firm that had beenselling the ETF puts in a creation order of  units to flatten its position. Thefirm that had been buying the ETF submits a redemption order of the samesize to flatten its own position. In this scenario, the ETF exhibited a veryhigh trading volume on the day but its net assets AUM will not change.Now lets look at a scenario where a sovereign wealth fund is buyinglarge blocks of a particular ETF from a liquidity provider that is selling theP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONETF to the client and buying the underlying basket to hedge its position.At the end of the day, the liquidity provider submits a creation order in theETF. This will show up as an increase in AUM and an increase in sharesoutstanding of the ETF.Another client is interested in making a large investment in a new ETFthat currently only has  million in assets. The client wants to make a million investment and is concerned about owning the entire fund andall of its assets. It agrees to go ahead with the trade and has an AuthorizedParticipant AP process an NAVbased transaction for the desired investment size. The AP buys the underlying basket of stocks at the closing priceand submits a creation order for  million of the fund in creation unitform. When the transaction is finalized, the client does not own  ofthe fund, since the creation causes the assets of the fund to double the clientwill own only  of the AUM and  of the shares outstanding.These short stories highlight some important points When you buy shares in the secondary market, you are not necessarilyhaving an effect on the number of outstanding shares in a fund or itsAUM. If you are buying from someone who is just selling a long positionthat they had or is going to turn around and buy the shares back in themarket, then the activity may not cause a creation to be done. Withouta creation or redemption, the fund AUM and shares outstanding do notchange. This highlights the difference between activity in the secondarymarket on the exchange and in the primary market via the creationand redemption process. When creations or redemptions are done, they directly affect the sharesoutstanding and the AUM of an ETF, but they do not have any effect ontrading volume. If you have an AP process an agency creation that doesnot run through its principal trading books and you receive the sharesof the ETF at the price as delineated by the transfer agent, then the ETFtrade will not be printed to the consolidated tape and will not have aneffect on trading volume. If, however, a creation is done on behalf of aclient order and the price to the client is different from that of the NAV,then the order will be printed to the tape. Trading volume is not always an indicator of an ETF gaining assets. Formany of the ETFs considered trading vehicles, they can be traded backand forth in the secondary market without any change in the primaryissuance. The AUM and shares outstanding can change dramatically on a dailybasis. This is most apparent in newer ETFs, where they are usuallyseeded with one creation unit. If the launch is successful, within afew days there can be another creation doubling the AUM and sharesP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to ComeTrading Volumes and ETF Liquidity outstanding of the fund. This can also happen at any point in the life ofthe fund and is merely a function of the underlying liquidity of the ETF.A fund with  billion in AUM can take in  billion creation orderif the underlying basket has that kind of liquidity available. And thesame can happen in the reverse direction via the redemption process. ETFs have no lockup on assets. The structure is essentially a bet thattransparency and flexibility will lead to higher assets over time withoutthe need for a fixed amount of shares outstanding or the need to havegates on asset redemptions. It is as easy to exit from an ETF positionvia a redemption order as it is to do an initial purchase. I cannot recallany ETF that has halted redemptions for any extended amount of timesimilar to what was experienced by hedge fund investors in .In Exhibit ., you can see some examples of client order flow facilitationand how assets get into funds via the creation process. All the client businessin the example is done on the secondary market, and then the AP utilizesthe creation process to manage the positions on its books.The AUM and the shares outstanding number need to be examinedtogether to determine whether an ETF that is growing in assets is doingso because of market moves or share purchases. Looking at just the AUMprovides a valid snapshot of assets at any one moment in time, but it doesnot tell a complete story. Sometimes the AUM can lead people to believe thatan ETF is too small for the size of an intended investment. Because of theopenended issuance available in the ETF wrapper, however, the liquidityof the underlying basket is a much better way to determine how muchcan be invested in any fund. If there is a lot of liquidity in the underlyingbasket, an ETF can grow its assets very quickly as baskets are bought andcreation orders are submitted. The AUM should be combined with the sharesoutstanding and sometimes even the volume numbers to present a completepicture of the money flows in the ETF.Where Money Flows Can Steer You WrongShares outstanding alone do not present clear indicators of money flows,investor demand, or rising prices in an ETF. In Exhibit ., you can see theshares outstanding dark line charted against the closing price light line ofXLF a financial sector ETF during the financial meltdown of .Domestic and international sector ETFs typically are used as access andhedging vehicles. In this case, many people were using the XLF as a hedgingtool or as a vehicle to achieve short exposure, and that short activity wasdriving shares outstanding.

Then, in the oval on the right, you can see the spikenear the March  lows when people started to fear that there would bea further downdraft in the markets.I mention that shares outstanding are not a valid indicator of investordemand on their own. Lets take a look at that in relation to Exhibit .and the shares outstanding spike in XLF as its value dropped. In order toshort an ETF as a hedge against your position, you first need to borrow theshares. In a stock, when you borrow shares, they are typically lent througha clearing broker utilizing long positions on the books. This is the same inmany ETFs however, if there are not a lot of outright long holders of anP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to ComeTrading Volumes and ETF Liquidity JanFebMarMayJunAugSepOctDecJanMarAprJunJulShares Outstanding Last PriceEXHIB IT .

This would entail being short the underlying basket andlong the ETFa marketneutral positionand various financing costs onyour books that can result in either a profit or loss. In the case of XLF,it was possible to be long the ETF and short the basket and lend the ETFshares out while generating a net positive return on the financing costs. Thisstrategy is discussed in further detail in Chapter .If you had been tracking AUM in the fund or shares outstanding, andwere not aware of the financial meltdown, you might buy into XLF. Youmight have thought from the shares outstanding increases that that is wherethe money was flowing. This would have been a fateful mistake. It is also onethat, surprisingly, is still made quite often in analysis of ETFs. It is importantto note that assets rising in ETFs could be from buyers or sellers and shouldnot be the only criteria in determining trading trends. Lets further examinemoney flows into and out of the ETFs and why.Money Flows of the BuyersAs discussed in Part One, an ETF is born when a basket ofstocks is delivered to the issuers custodian and, in turn, thatissuer delivers shares of the ETF to the initial creator. This isreferred to as the initial creation unit. One way that an ETFgrows is when the Authorized Participants who have contracted with theissuer to provide their services begin the process of consolidating chunks ofbaskets and ETFs and exchanging them with the issuers.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONETF DeliveredMoney DeliveredCustomerBuyerAuthorizedParticipantA Buy ETF on theExchangeB Buy theunderlying basketC Buy acorrelating hedgeEXHIB IT . Methods of Hedging when Providing LiquidityExhibit . shows a very basic picture of the beginning steps of interactions between the customer and the AP. In this example, the customer isa buyer. The customer has transacted with the AP either electronically ormanually, buying the ETF from the AP. Only three scenarios can then place.In scenario A, the AP, acting as an agent, went out and bought the ETFon the exchange for the client. In scenarios B and C, the AP was providingliquidity and acted in a principal capacity. The AP sold the ETF shares tothe client. APs have two choices with regard to hedging the position. Theycan either buy the exact basket of the ETF, if it is trading at the same timeas the ETF trade, or they can buy some other correlating asset that they useto hedge their short position in the ETF.In case A, the AP ends up buying the ETF on the exchange, on the clientsbehalf. In this case, an AP is not required to do anything further because it ismerely acting as a middleman between the market and the customer. Whatis happening, however, is that the AP probably is buying the ETF sharesfrom a liquidity provider LP somewhere along the order flow chain. Atsome point, that order flow gets into a scenario like that of case B.In case B, the AP sells the ETF to the customer and is able to buy theunderlying basket that replicates the ETF. The position on the books of theAP will be short the ETF and long the basket. Then the AP would process acreation with the issuer. This would require the AP to deliver the shares thatit is long of the underlying basket to the issuer and it would, in turn, receivethe shares of the ETF. The APs position would be flat, and the issuer wouldhave increased the shares outstanding in the fund, simultaneously increasingthe AUM. This is always the ideal scenario for the issuer.In case C, the AP buys some correlating hedge that tracks the ETF well.Since doing so implies that there will be financing charges in maintainingP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to ComeTrading Volumes and ETF Liquidity the long hedge and short ETF position, this is ideally a shortterm solution.At some point in the future, the AP either intends to unwind the short ETFposition and the hedge or will want to exchange the hedge for the basket ofunderlying stocks and then proceed to do a creation.In summary, if there are many buyers of the ETF, then LPs who are selling the ETF could be buying the underlying basket to hedge their exposure.They would then process a creation, delivering the basket to the issuer andreceiving in return ETF shares. This would flatten out the position on theLPs books, leaving the LP with no exposure and no balance sheet position.It would leave the customer with the long position in the ETF. And it wouldleave the ETF issuer with a basket of stocks and a theoretical short position in the ETF, which is referred to as the shares outstanding. The sharesthat the issuer has delivered in exchange for those baskets of stocks are thenew shares outstanding of the fund.Because the shares outstanding number can fluctuate wildly dependingon supply and demand of ETF shares, it becomes a very important indicatorof interest in a specific product, but it is not indicative of market direction. Ifpotential clients are looking at a fund with only , shares outstanding,and they had the intention of buying , shares, they should not beconcerned about owning  of the fund. Because of the structure, theywill buy the shares from an LP who will in turn receive the shares fromthe issuer. So whereas the client might have been wary of buying  ofthe shares outstanding, a short time after the transaction is completed, theclients holding of , shares will represent only  of the sharesoutstanding. Also at this point, assuming no drastic market price moves, theAUM of the fund will have doubled as well.TRADING TIPIt is important to realize that when you make an actual investmentin an ETF, at some point down the order flow chain it will lead toa creationunless it happens to be offset by someone unwinding aninvestment at the same time. The LP is not unwinding an investmentbut acting as the middleman between the customer and the issuer.When you are putting a large amount of assets into a small fund, thefunds AUM will increase by your investment. You are most likely notbuying a piece of the assets already in the fund, but receiving liquidityfrom someone that will pursue a creation to increase the fund sharesoutstanding and the AUM.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONThis activity also serves to highlight why the ETF almost always will betrading at a price near the value of its underlying basket. If the basket startstrading away from the ETF price, the LP always can sell the ETF and buythe basket of shares to create more available units of the ETF. It works likea pressure release valve on the pricing of the ETF. Arbitrage traders will bein the marketplace looking for any pricing differences. They are, by default,keeping the ETF price in line with the value of its underlying assets.Money Flows of the Sel lersShort activity in ETFs is often misunderstood. As a representative of an ETFprovider, many times I have explained to clients how I would really love tohave them put on a huge short position in our products. Clients respondedwith confusion. They did not understand why I, as an asset manager, wouldwant them to short my products. I would explain that an ETF issuer isactually providing a tool that can be used for tailoring portfolio exposures.There are many places where using that tool to achieve short exposures isapplicable. Clients would ask If everyone wanted to use that tool for shortexposure, what would that do to assets At this point I would describewhat I have just presented with regard to share spikes when markets drop.Shorting the ETF can drive assets into the fund because someone needs tofacilitate that short by providing a loan of the ETF shares.A very profitable trade on the brokerage side of the ETF industry iscreating ETFs to facilitate stock loan. Because the market in stock loans isso fractured and is still mostly an overthecounter marketplace, there arestill profits to be reaped providing ETF borrows to clients. In the case ofsomeone shorting an ETF, typically an AP will go out and do a short creationof the ETF to facilitate the stock loan. This means the AP will borrow theunderlying basket and deliver it to the issuer who will in turn deliver outthe ETF shares increasing the shares outstanding, which can then be lentto the end client.Comparisons to CEFs and Mutual FundsThe process of creation and redemption is very different from what happensin a closedend fund. A CEF has a fixed amount of shares outstanding. Ifyou are buying shares in the secondary market, there is no way for yourcounterparty to access the primary market for the issuer to create moreshares, so you actually will create pressure on the fund price. If you want tobuy , shares of a CEF with , shares outstanding, you couldhave a significant effect on the price of the fund as you vacuum up all of theavailable shares in the marketplace.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to ComeTrading Volumes and ETF Liquidity A similarity between ETFs and mutual funds is their openended issuance function. In the case of a mutual fund, investors are delivering cashand a portfolio management team is going out and buying the basket ofshares for the portfolio and then issuing you shares of the fund. In contrast,with the ETF, the LP is buying the basket of shares for the portfolio anddelivering them to the ETF issuer in the proper format. This is what leadsto the tax of the advantages of the ETF structure a fund manager buyingand selling stock will create taxable events within the fund. Since an ETF isreceiving and delivering its stock holdings as part of an inkind transaction,the portfolio can be managed in a more efficient manner.CONCLUSIONTrading volumes of the ETFs themselves tell a very interesting story. Theydo not, however, tell the whole story. Currently the market for ETFs is expanding quickly in terms of various products offered, but the assets flowinginto those new products are moving slowly. Part of the problem is that techniques in facilitating trading flows have not advanced as quickly as demandto use this new ETF structure. Hopefully after reading this chapter you havegained an understanding of the concepts explained regarding how assetsgrow and what effects the various types of trading and money flows haveon ETFs. I expect the trading side of ETFs to expand rapidly over the nextfew years to provide the required facilitation for the increasing demand ofthe client base. Once the problems of ETF incubation are solved, as delineated in Chapter , then the broadening investor base and their desire to usethe many different types of products available will force growth of tradingcapabilities at the LPs.An ETF that is trading with a very small daily average volume can still beaccessed via its underlying basket. This is discussed in detail in Chapter .Making this underlying liquidity available to the broader client base in a costeffective manner has proven to be a bottleneck in the ETF growth curve. InChapter  we assess the underlying basket liquidity and the trading modelused to facilitate ETF flow based on that underlying liquidity.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner February ,   Printer Yet to ComeP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeCHAPTER ETF Trading BusinessAssessing and Providing LiquidityImention frequently that the liquidity of an exchangetraded fund ETF isbased on the underlying basket. Assessing that liquidity and being able toprovide ETF trading liquidity based upon it are incredibly important for thefuture growth of the product structure. There are high barriers to entry forproviding liquidity in ETFs. The ability to trade globally in multiple assetclasses and manage position risks in thousands of securities simultaneouslyare the basic requirements.This chapter discusses the trading model that is at the heart of thatsystem. The primary function is to take the universe of ETFs and calculate afair value for each product and assess the liquidity available via the basketand other derivatives. Then I discuss liquidity assessments of the basket andwhat constraints can affect the liquidity of the ETF.At the end of this chapter I present the requirements for building an ETFcustomer facilitation business. I could probably package this one piece andsell it as a consultant, but it makes more sense for it to be out in the publicdomain so that more businesses can be built. Besides, knowing what to dois only one piece of the puzzle, being able to implement it is a completelydifferent story. This should give users of ETFs an idea of the backbone theyare leveraging when they place a simple ETF order.The knowledge of valuation and trading brings us to a very importantpart of the process for the broad investor base. In Chapter  I discuss thevarious methods and techniques available for executing order flow. Utilizingthe variety of ways available for executing order flow and understandinghow it will be evolving in the future is invaluable for the continued expansionof the ETF product lines.Lets see what the liquidity providers are looking at when they see ourorders come into the system first. Then we can decide how to place thoseorders.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONTRADING MODELThe structure of the ETF enables the trading of either the underlying basketor the ETF itself to attain the same exposures. Since there are two separateand distinct vehicles trading in the marketplace, there are opportunities forarbitrage, or an interchange of liquidity, between the two. In order to dothis, you would have to be watching, either physically or via an algorithm,the spread between the basket and the ETF. Understanding the availableliquidity of the underlying basket is also important.Liquidity providers LPs will have different needs depending on theirposition within the ETF ecosystem. If you are satisfying institutional demandand facilitating largeblock order flow, you will need to know more aboutmarket depth to estimate potential available supply against your larger markets. If you are providing liquidity versus the retail order flow, your positionin an ETF might be very small and changing dramatically throughout theday, as customer buyers and sellers interact with your trading book. Additionally, if you are facilitating flow for a customer base and do not makemarkets in all ETFs directly, you will need to know where to go to sourceliquidity when necessary.Lets take a look at a trading model for an ETF and what the piecescontribute in terms of information for providing and determining liquidity.The trading model displayed in Exhibit . is a version of what tradersare looking at when determining what trading opportunities exist in themarketplace. Although the automated systems are not physically looking ata screen like this, it includes all of the embedded calculations necessary tomake an immediate trading decision for an electronic arbitrage system.The ETF quote line shows a realtime market view of what is seen whenlooking at a level  quote. The level  quote shows just the top of the orderbook, the inside market bid and ask quotes. It does not show any depth ofbook statistics. The size in shares is also included, shown on each side of theEXHIB IT .

The way to read that quote line would be There is a . bidfor  shares, and there are , shares offered at ..TRADING TIPTerminology note Shares are always bid for and offered at. Whencustomers are buyers and are curious at what price they might be ableto buy an ETF, they might ask, What is the offer The reply would beThe shares are offered at  price. If customers are sellers, they mighthear, There is a  bid for  amount of shares. A standard quotein a stock or ETF would be phrased  bid for , shares and, shares offered at .. This would represent a market thatis .  ., ,  ,. These terms are dying out as floortrading and quoting goes away but still can be important in the ETFmarket, because, when asking a LP for a market, proper terminologyensures that the proper transaction takes place.In Exhibit ., the ETF last traded at .. The screen does not showthe amount of shares that last traded at that price. Just below that line is aconversion to show the notional size available on each side of the market.You can see that there is approximately , worth of the ETF availableat the offer, ., or , shares.The most important line is the calculated intraday indicative value IIVline. This shows what the calculated value of the underlying basket of theETF is worth. It also shows an implied size of the ETF available by sending anorder in the basket for each stock. This line is read in a similar manner to thequote line There is a . bid for , shares and there are ,shares offered at .. This line is quoted in ETF terms even though itis being calculated from the basket underlying the ETF. You can buy theactual ETF in the market, or you can buy the exact basket underlying theETF and convert it into ETF shares via the creation redemption mechanism.This is probably one of the most important concepts in the understandingof how an ETF works.Liquidity is assessed, therefore, not by looking at ETF volume or basketvolume alone but by consolidating those numbers to determine what potentially could be traded. Because the market for the actual ETF in this exampleis so smallonly , shares offeredit does not have much impact onthe overall market of the ETF. The , shares offered in basket termsis really the true top of book liquidity underlying the ETF.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONCalculat ing Market Depth for TradingIt is also important to note here that both quotes just discussedare based strictly on what is being shown on the inside market.The ETF quote line is a picture of the inside market in the ETF.The calculated IIV line shows what is being implied by the insidemarkets in each stock in the basket. Although calculating the IIV impliedprices of the ETF is straightforward, calculating the implied size is morecomplicated because each stock is required in a different amount to satisfythe ETF basket. The ETF basket requirements are published daily. In orderto calculate the implied IIV line, the system has to understand how manyshares of each stock are required to formulate the proper basket. It can thencalculate the implied price and the amount of ETF shares available. Theamount of shares of the ETF available as implied by the basket is restrictedby the lowest factor of shares required per creation unit multiplied by theshares available on the market.Exhibit . utilizes several columns in calculating IIV and the impliedliquidity. The exhibit shows just part of an ETF basket comprised of severalhundred stocks. The creation unit CU shares column shows how manyshares of each stock are needed to compose one unit of the ETF. In this case,one unit of the ETF equals , shares of the ETF. As displayed, shares of NKE are required to make each unit of the ETF. The bid and askCU factor outlined is the amount of shares shown on the market divided bythe amount of shares required for each CU. In this case there are  shares ofNHP required for each creation unit, and there are only  shares of NHPoffered at .. This implies that, at most, you can take the offer in NHPand translate that into . units of the ETF. Since the creationredemptionmechanism works only in fullunit sizes, the Authorized Participant wouldbe able to create only five units of the ETF, or , shares.The models displayed show only level  price and volume calculations.A more sophisticated system would look deeper into the book and calculateEXHIB IT .

If you are an electronic LP and you are posting small bids and offers, the depth of book isimportant as a forecasting tool. You might use it to estimate important pricepoints. If you are on an institutional trading desk and are attempting to facilitate largeblock flow in ETFs, a true depth finder calculation is extremelyimportant. If you are bidding for or offering  million shares in an ETF andthere are only , shares offered on the screen and only maybe another, shares offered in implied basket terms, it is important to understandwhat is available further into the markets. It is possible that there are only, shares offered in implied basket terms, but  cent away higher onthe offer side, there are another , implied shares offered in basketterms. Assuming you had a fast and dependable basket trading system, youmight be very comfortable offering  million shares based on that impliedprice and depth.Unfortunately, because of fragmentation that has led to the decrease indisplayed share size in the markets, it has become very tough for anyone totruly determine where liquidity resides in the markets. It has thus becomevery technologically intensive to develop a system for determining ETF underlying liquidity via the baskets of constituents. But the ETF and the basket,in funds with domestic constituents, can be traded on an interchangeablebasis. Only recently has this functionality become more widely available tothe broader ETF customer base as it expands and demands more services.Typically this was the domain of large institutional investors who had accessto the portfolio trading desks at the large brokerdealers.Now, however, there are agencyonly style brokers entering the business of creating and redeeming ETF shares using the underlying baskets forcustomers. This is not strictly limited to ETFs that trade during the samehours that the basket is traded because, in many cases, shares of the ETFare not traded in the market at all i.e., U.S.listed ETFs with internationalconstituents. The broker will go into the marketplace and strictly use theunderlying basket to give the client an execution in ETF shares at the impliedprice of the basket trade. This is big business for baskettrading businessesglobally.MEASURING POTENTIAL AVAILABLE ETF L IQUID ITYThe volume tables in Chapter  tell a story about an investorbase that is not getting sufficient education and access to products available via the underlying baskets. In my past life, I wason trading desks and personally steered customers to more liquid ETFs because either my system was not advanced enough to be pricingP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONall ETFs a technology constraint or I did not want to trade the underlyingbasket because it was unfamiliar to me and would lead to a lot more workthan other products. The separation between trading and issuance in the ETFstructure is fantastic in many ways the one main detraction is that the issuerdoes not control the execution process, and there are a lot of places wherethat process can go wrong while trying to get a customer trade on the tape.The liquidity of an ETF is one of the most misunderstood pieces of theentire structure. It is a hotly debated concept primarily because many peopledo not fully comprehend that ETF valuations are derived as a function oftheir underlying constituents and that there are alternative ways to createliquidity beyond use of the ETF itself. Because of the openended issuancemechanism of the ETF structure, the true available liquidity in an ETF isa function of its underlying basket. The LPs are acting as intermediariesbetween clients and the underlying liquidity of the basket of stocks. Nextwe turn to some details regarding how to measure that potential liquidity.A great way to look at the implied liquidity in an ETF is based on tradinga specified percentage of the volume in its underlying basket. You can take ameasure of the daily average volume of each of the stocks in the underlyingbasket and calculate that you could trade some percent of that volume foreach name in the basket. Then, via the creation and redemption process,you can convert from the basket to the ETF or from the ETF to the basket.In this example we start with the assumption that you can trade  of thedaily average volume of a stock without having an impact on its price.The creation unit equates to a specified amount of shares of the ETF,typically between , and , shares. We look at the average dailyvolume ADV for the last month to make an assessment on viability basedon how much of each underlying stock we would need to trade to equate toour ETF shares. We then have the number of shares that we can comfortablytrade on a given day without causing a disruption in the underlying stockprices. It could be, as in the example,  of the ADV, but a portfolioanalytics group could run an analysis on the basket and give you a differentpercentage based on the actual stocks in the basket or any number of otherconstraints. If the underlying basket is the Dow Jones Industrial Averageand you have  stocks with a tremendous amount of volume, you maybe able to trade a higher percentage of their ADV without affecting theirpricing action throughout the day. When you take the proper percentageof the ADV of each stock in the basket, you can divide that number ofshares possible to trade by the amount of shares required of each stock for acreation unit. This gives you a multiplier of how many units of the ETF canbe created or redeemed. When you multiply this by the number of sharesin the creation unit, your result is an implied number of ETF shares thatyou can trade in a day. This does not take into consideration the abilityP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETF Trading Business to trade the actual ETF in the market at the same time or to trade otherderivatives.TRADING TIPThe implied daily tradable shares IDTS number for an ETF is a muchbetter indication of the ETFs available liquidity than the ADV. However, the IDTS is not readily available to end investors. It requires thecomputing power of portfolio trading and analytics systems. It does notinclude related derivatives available and how much additional volumecan be implied by interactions with those products.It is important to understand the base case, using assumptions of adomestic equity basket with no derivatives. From there you can calculatechanges to the base IDTS accounting for other available correlating vehiclesor other external factors. Understanding this calculation will enable you tomake judgments about potential ETFs that trade less daily average volumethan you normally would consider but offer other exposures that potentiallywill be more valuable for your portfolio.In Exhibit ., you can see the calculation implied by the stocks oftwo very similar ETFs in the U.S. marketplace. It shows only the bottom names of each basket, in terms of implied liquidity, which serves to highlightwhere the volume restrictions are for each ETF. In the ETFB basket, you cansee that BSX serves as a block to trading extremely large volume of the ETF.In this example, BSX trades an average of , shares per day. The ETFrequires  shares of BSX to create one unit of the ETF, equaling ,shares. If you were able to trade  of the ADV of BSX, and if you tradedthe rest of the basket as stipulated, you could potentially create  millionshares of the ETF via the creation mechanism. If BSX were not in the basket,then the next smallest available stock would be TSS. It generates a largersize restriction of  million shares, signifying there is much more liquidityavailable. This example highlights the importance of screening baskets forunderlying liquidity when developing new ETF products.If the issuer were to remove BSX from the basket of ETFB, then theoverall implied liquidity of that ETF would rise dramatically. Since thatliquidity is always restrained by the most restrictive constituent, it wouldcreate a situation where ETFB theoretically would be more liquid than ETFA. The situation is currently presented where ETFA has more theoreticalliquidity because of the higher minimum implied amount of shares able tobe created.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONEXHIB IT .

It is also extremely valuable in makingan assessment of an ETF that has an equity basket trading during a differenttime frame. I use the United States as an example because with the basketand the ETF trading simultaneously, an LP can provide a market to a clientand hedge its exposure immediately. This fits into the parameters of runninga marketmaking business. You may be, however, transitioning a portfolioof assets from a mutual fund environment, where you are accustomed toonceaday liquidity based on delivery and receipt of cash, and you wantto use ETFs for their transparency and relative cheapness. In that case, theactual trading volume of an ETF is completely irrelevant to you. In thisscenario, you should be much more interested in what the IDTS of the ETFis this figure shows you what type of size can be achieved by having someonetrade the basket for you to provide a net asset value NAV or implied NAVexecution in the ETF.REQUIREMENTS FOR AN ETF TRADING BUSINESSIn order to provide the investor client base access to this underlying basketliquidity, the brokerage community has to continue developing the businesses that provide ETF liquidity. Over the last several years, many tradingfirms have developed desks that provide liquidity in ETFs utilizing the arbitrage mechanism.There seems to be room in the industry for further participants who areconsidering developing broad businesses to satisfy a growing client base inETF order flow. I present the following ETF business strategic requirementsplan as a basis for some of the development that will be necessary to buildthat business.Many of the ETF businesses on the Street have many, if not all, of theparts of this business plan.Database Requirements A broad data warehouse comprised of ETFs and linkages to underlyingbaskets of stocks and futures where applicable. ETF data file storage and parsing abilities for both domestic and international ETFs. Monitoring and processing of corporate actions and dividends for theuniverse.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTION Monitor funding rates and stock availability with a stock loan.

It must have fast quoting abilities in active markets in a universe ofseveral thousand ETFs and underlyings. It should be able to displayflag halted stocks and those not open fortrading within each basket by ETF. This will be developed with clicktotrade abilities versus customer flowrunning through the book. This will get all its information from the data warehouse describedearlier.ETF Trading System The system should provide the ability to trade the futures, the ETF inall venues, or the basket of underlying stocks. The key to this system is the ability to trade multiple ETFs or corresponding hedges in concert, with a good order management system fortracking and monitoring executions and making adjustments based onmarket dynamics. A basketmonitoring function must be able to show completion percentages and singlestock delta that exists from incomplete orders. The ability to send a combination of baskets, futures, and spray the Electronic Communications Networks ECNs would be optimal based on atarget quantity of the underlying ETF i.e., market spray functionality.Risk Management and Profit and Loss PnL Monitoring System This system handles all positions, showing a delta in singlestock termsbased on decomposing the ETFs and futures down to stock level. It also shows calculations on daily funding, stock loan, dividends, andfair value. It should be able to separate positions into multiple risk books, such asindex funds, sector funds, and the like. It should be able to show a PnL breakdown between the ETFs andbasketsfutures for analysis.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeETF Trading Business  The system must be able to handle the manual input of trades doneoutside the system, either versus customers or with brokers. It should show a realtime delta and PnL for all positions.Client Order OMS This system receives orders from the sales force in ETFs and sends backfills. It maintains the required electronic time stamp on customer order flow. It enables both agency execution of order flow or principal facilitationvia the crossing facilities. It should be able to electronically feed principal positions to the riskmanagement system for delta management. It also performs the functions of commission tracking and electronictransfer of trades to the middle office for processing.CONCLUSIONThe models for providing liquidity in ETFs can be complicated to build andmaintain. And the requirements to build a fullservice liquidity business inthe products also are capital intensive. However, we are at the very beginningof what can potentially be a very long cycle of product use and developmentthat will make all of those investments worthwhile.The markets in the United States are suffering from severe fragmentation. Intelligent systems that scour markets for mispriced securities areleading to the deterioration of displayed depth in the markets. Dark poolsand aggregators and ways to trade around the exchanges have made anypublished size vulnerable to aggressive trading strategies. It is unfortunatefor the financial infrastructure that the very machines designed to aid in securities trading efficiency have combined with poor regulations to diminishsome of that efficiency. For the past several years I have inaccurately predicted the demise of hightouch order brokerage because of its inefficiencycompared to the machines, only to see that business continue to flourishbecause market fragmentation actually creates a greater need for humanintervention.In this volume, I look at execution as an exercise in capital preservation and efficiency. I examine the optimum methods for accessing the truehidden liquidity of ETFs. I do not dispute that there are spreads, but I doquestion the notion that they are more egregious than the opportunity costsof not utilizing these products. There are hurdles to overcome to achievethis liquidity, but the markets are continually evolving. It is becoming everP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONeasier for the average investor, money manager, or trader to take advantageof the gains that await.There are three parts to achieving many ETF investment goals, as presented in this ETF handbook understanding the products Part One, learning how the prices are derived Part Two, and understanding who yourlikely counterparts are in the marketplace, their intentions, and how to execute your order flow Part Three. In Chapter  we examine the strategiesavailable for efficient execution of ETF order flow.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeCHAPTER ExecutionHandling Client Order Flow and AchievingExecution in ETFsT his book was conceived around my work educating people on theexchangetraded fund ETF mechanism and the best ways to executeETF order flow. Many fantastic products available in the ETF marketplaceare not yet being utilized effectively by the investing public.An interesting aspect of the ETF structure is that it removes most tradingand execution from the asset management side of the business. This is acomplete divergence from the mutual fund business that controls the buyingand selling of assets and uses that order flow to pay commissions to WallStreet. At the core of the ETF business, the investor controls the buying andselling of assets, and this is causing a shift in the balance of power. There isclearly a dramatic rise in selfdirected and advisorguided assets in ETFs thatare leading to changes in the way brokerage firms do business. In addition,the fact that making markets in ETFs typically requires the use of firm capitalis going to necessitate a rethinking of order flow at the large firms that steerdiscretionary order flow away from the proprietary businesses where theETF desk resides. It makes no sense for the wealth management business ata large brokerage firm to steer client ETF business away from the inhouseETF liquidity desk. Over time, as it becomes clear that ETFs are becominga huge part of the wealth management business and that a tremendousamount of commissions are being paid away to the Street for executionsthat can be facilitated more efficiently inhouse, this order flow processwill change.Another important point is that the ETF issuer has no ability to controlthe width and depth of markets in their products. The liquidityprovidingfunction of ETFs is completely separate and distinct from the business ofmanaging those assets. The backstop liquidity providers are the lead marketP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONmakers LMMs that are under basic requirements by the exchange. Beyondthem, liquidity providers LPs in ETFs are in business to make money. Theyare not there as a service provided by ETF issuers, and they are not alwayslooking out for the best interests of the client base.As I considered the issues that arise throughout my client meetings,I began to realize that the execution of ETFs is a stumbling block formany clients and products. The early adopters of any product are willingto get their hands dirty and figure it out. They are willing to work throughkinks. They typically come to a product as seekers, looking to understand itsmysteries. The second group consists of more general users they have determined that the product will satisfy a need. They want to use the productbut may have expectations for how the product should work as opposed tohow it actually does work. Many of the newer adopters of the ETF productline think the product works just like a stock since it is listed like otherequity products. Looking at an ETF simply like a stock is not utilizing manyof its features, which are unavailable in an ordinary stock investment. Itis the equivalent of buying an iPhone to merely make phone calls, withoutacknowledging any of its other features.Taking this one step further, many of the newer users of the ETF productline are migrating over from portfolios of mutual funds. They are used tonet asset value NAV executions once a day. They are not accustomedto looking at markets during an execution process. With a mutual fund,the execution is ignored as a backoffice procedure of delivering cash andseeing a journal entry in your portfolio the next day. In the world of anETF, execution is incredibly important. In this chapter, we discuss manyof the important ways of handling order flow in ETFs. The informationin this chapter alone should make owning this book mandatory for everytrader and execution flow staff member who handles orders in exchangelisted funds.TIME FRAMES AND ORDER TYPESThe New York Stock Exchange NYSE Arca makes roughly different order types available for people to utilize when sendingorders down to the exchange. The program trading desks andthe electronic trading firms use most of the various order types.By contrast, most customer flow utilizes only a few different types of orders,overwhelmingly market or limit orders.When trading in an ETF, there are several different methods and specifictimes for placing and executing orders.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution Execut ion Time FramesThere are two time frames in which you can execute an ETF order in aU.S.listed ETF. During the U.S. trading day, while the U.S.listed ETF is trading. During the hours when the underlying basket is tradingIf it is during the U.S. trading hours and the ETF has a basket of domesticconstituents, you can execute an order for the ETF in either the actual sharesof that ETF or by trading the underlying basket of stocks and convertingthose executions into an ETF price. If the constituents of the basket are notU.S.listed stocks, you can either execute order flow in the ETF shares onthe exchange, or you can utilize the basket of constituents during their localtrading hours and have the traded price implied back into an ETF price andexecution. This is what I refer to as an NAVbased execution.TRADING TIPLets take an example of an ETF with Japanese underlying stocks thattrades in the United States. You can trade the ETF during the U.S.trading day while the markets are open, and even on either side ofmarket open and close because of afterhours and premarket trading.Additionally, you could theoretically trade the ETF during the hoursthat the Japanese markets are open because someone can execute theentire basket making up the creation unit CU of the ETF and generate an implied price for the ETF. If the ETF is trading at a time whenthe underlying basket of stocks is closed, the ETF is acting like a pricediscovery vehicle for where that basket will be when it next starts trading. This was discussed in Chapter  when we covered the calculationof intraday indicative value IIV and the need for an estimated NAVeNAV calculation.Types of Execut ionDuring the two times frames, you can use these types of executions to achieveyour desired exposure Market orders Limit ordersP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTION Algorithms Risk markets NAVIIVbased executionsThroughout this chapter we go through these types of executions indetail. We end with several different examples of executions in the various types.MARKET ORDERSThe main order type used by noninstitutional investors is the market order.This is an order type that sends an order to the marketplace and gives thesystems and other market participants the opportunity to trade against itwith no specific limitations regarding at what price the order will get filled.It sweeps the order book and does not stop until it is complete. In ourcurrent world of multiple exchanges, dark pools, and electronically hiddenliquidity, market orders are not a costeffective way to trade ETFs. The speedand abilities of systems to determine that orders are open to market pricing,and the ability to game those types of orders, has established the marketorder as impractical in any ETF beyond those with the utmost liquidity.When trading an ETF that has a relatively low intraday trading volume,sending market orders can be devastating.Lets take a look at what can happen in a worstcase scenario witha market order in a lowvolume ETF. In this example, an ETF tradesfewer than , shares daily. The typical market for this ETF is about cents wide, and the typical depth provided by an LMM is about shares on two levels. In Exhibit . you can see the . bid for EXHIB IT . Simulated Order BookMarket OrderBid Size Bid Ask Ask Size  . .   . .   . .   . .   . .   . .   . .   . .   . .   . .

And you can see  shares offered at . and another  offered at ., as the second level ofliquidity.Now lets say a buy order comes in to buy , shares of the ETF atthe market. If the order book was as displayed in Exhibit . and had nohidden size, the order would make these purchases. . . . . . . . This would give an execution of an order to buy , shares at themarket at an average price of .. Again, this is based on the assumption of no hidden liquidity in the system and no one simultaneously comingin to sell the same ETF.This order has actually missed on two fronts. The first is that the marketorder probably took out the two levels of liquidity provided by the LMMand did not give the systems a chance to refresh before the order continuedtaking all other liquidity it could find. Additionally, it did not give a LP achance to execute against the underlying basket to satisfy the order. If thiswas an ETF with domestic underlying stocks, an LP might have been willingto sell the ETF at a slight profit to the basket to accommodate the trade.Lets say that the basket was priced at . to ., with an impliedliquidity of several hundred thousand shares on each side. If the LP couldsell the ETF balance of , shares at ., cover its trading expenses,and make a profit, the order could potentially have been filled much moreefficiently. In an extremely liquid ETF, part of that liquidity is coming fromelectronic systems monitoring and competing in the markets for arbitrageopportunities. This protects the outcome from being terribly expensive ina product in which a lot of people are trading. But in a less liquid ETF,those systems are not necessarily set up, as there are fewer participants oropportunities. There is little chance a market order can be efficient in anyETF that is not in that highestvolume bucket above  million averagedaily shares traded, that is, based on investment order flow. If you arean electronic trading business, then market orders may work within theparameters of your strategy.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONL IMIT ORDERSThe limit order is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the marketorder. While a market order leaves you dependent on the environment ofthe marketplace to determine an execution price for your order, a limit orderis established with a fixed price limit in mind. A problem with this ordertype is that you have a much lower probability of getting a fill unless youare close to the market. The information in this book will help you placelimit orders within a reasonable tolerance level of ETF valuation. This willenable you to drive up your execution probabilities while saving yourselfmoney with good executions.You would use a limit order primarily in two circumstances. You have a set price that you are looking to trade at based on a modelor other expectation.. You are looking to transact at close to current market levels and willplace your limit accordingly.A limit order removes any spread from a trade. If you place an orderat a specified price and get filled, regardless of whether you chose to placeyour order in the middle of a bid and ask or in the middle of any other twohypothetical prices, you are not cutting a spread. You are trading at a pricethat was predetermined. If you place a limit order and the market movestoward and through your order and you receive an execution, you alsoshould not suffer buyers remorse. Limit orders set below or at the bid sidetypically get filled when the market moves toward and across your limits.You have to expect some price movement through your limit for execution.In ETFs, limit orders getting filled are the result of either the underlyingvalue of the ETF moving through your limit range or sellers coming into themarketplace and moving the prices into your limit range. In a lowvolumeETF, you will frequently be dealing with either an LP or a market makerwatching the underlying value for an arbitrage opportunity. In order foreither to want to interact with your order, it will have to be able to positionits hedge at an advantageous price.It is important to understand the nature of your trading counterpartwhen trading in lowvolume ETFs because then you can place your limitorder properly to entice the arbitrageurs or wait for them, depending onyour own desires.Lets use the same market picture for a quick example of two marketsin which execution probability rises with the improved limit placement. InExhibit ., you can see that the market in the ETF is . to . shares up bid and offered. Lets continue with the understanding that theP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution EXHIB IT .

IIV for this ETF with domestic underlying constituents is showing as .to ..If you place a limit order at . for , shares, what might happenProbably nothing will happen until another customer seller of the ETF entersthe marketplace. An LP is not going to sell you the ETF at . becauseit would have to pay . to buy the basket equivalent or . to buythe ETF. So in a lowvolume ETF, nothing might happen for a long while,perhaps the entire trading day. In actuality, if you place your order at asimilar discount to IIV in a very liquid ETF, there is a high probability youwill not get filled either because it is very rare that a liquid ETF with domesticconstituents will be trading at a discount to IIV.If you place a limit order at . for , shares, what might happenThe odds of your getting filled have risen dramatically. If an LP sold theshares to you, it might be able to buy the basket at some point in the middleof the implied spread, . to ., and lock in a profit versus its ETFsale.Both of these orders were based on the premise that the market was notmoving around. A limit order placed at . might get filled if the marketmoves down, placing it in the range of either the offer side of the market orthe range of the underlying basket equivalent.Limit orders typically require market moves and interaction to get filled,but they also need to be within trading range in terms of price. There aremany occasions where a client has been bidding  cents below a marketfor an ETF, or even bid side, and not getting filled. In trading ETFs inthe marketplace, it seems as if your bid price will be wrong in order tobe executed. But this is a distinction of time frame and nothing more. Thearbitrageur is attempting to take advantage of pricing spreads between theETF and its underlying basket or proxy hedge. This is typically a businessof pennies and extremely short time periods. Your order should be placedin the context of a longerterm investment horizon. So the wrong priceactually may be the perfect price for you because, while you may be lookingfor a  gain, others may be looking to lock in a gain of . on thistrade before moving on to the next.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONIn a domestic ETF trading during the U.S. day, the proper trading levelis a function of where the basket is priced. If the basket is  cents wide andyou are on the bid side of a market that is  cents below the basket bid,you will have an extremely low probability of getting filled. Why wouldan LP sell an ETF below the bid side of the basket Typically, it wouldhit a bid that is above the offer side of the basket so it can concurrentlybuy the underlying basket to lock in its profit spread. But, again, this requires an understanding of the volatility of ETF prices. When you havea basket of stocks that is moving in a market and that is directly affecting the price movements of the ETF, there will be higher volatility in theETF price. Every tick in one of the underlying stocks causes a tick in theETF price. This causes the prices to move around within the basket bandand even causes the basket band to shift, causing even more tick volatility.It is possible to see through general observations that ETF tick volatilityand quote frequency are much higher than in single stocks. This is marketnoise and should be ignored by the average ETF investor. Decide on a pricebased on your valuation of the underlying basket of the ETF and your desired outcome and place your limit order. Let patience and the markets dothe rest.ALGORITHMSThe financial markets are composed of many layers of people answering tomany other layers of people. There is the portfolio manager who answers toinvestors and the trader who answers to the PM and the floor broker whoanswers to the trader client. None of these people wants to be the one to paythe wrong price for a security. So a PM, instead of giving a limit order to thetrader, would say, Buy me X at the market, letting the trader with his orher expertise in the marketplace determine the correct price. The trader, notwanting to have an effect on the market, would give the broker instructionsto be in the crowd going along with what other people are doing. If someoneasks why a certain price was paid for a security, someone in the chain canalways fall back on the support that other people were also paying that priceat that time. It is this psychology of market participants not wanting to paythe wrong price that helped lead to volume weighted average price VWAPand other algorithms.A great method to determine if your trading and execution are stackingup as compared to the rest of the Street is to trade based on how the rest ofthe Street is trading. In a VWAP order, you are basically willing to buysellin volume and prices proportional to those at which the security is tradingin the marketplace. You make no decisions as to how much to buy at eachP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution price level but leave it up to the wisdom of the crowd. If others are trading,then your order should be trading in the market as well. It is tough to be heldaccountable if you are only a small percentage of the volume trading at yourlevels. The VWAP has become a major metric in the pricing of order flow.An entire subindustry has been based around building models for trading toachieve this price.Other algorithms utilize different metrics to place orders systematicallyinto the marketplace. All of these systems attempt to get an execution basedon specific parameters with the intention of having a minimum effect onthe market price of the security. And all of these order types can be usedwhen trading ETFs. The beauty of algorithms with exchangetraded fundsis that you can use them either on the actual ETF or on the underlyingbasket of securities. In an ETF in which there is high average daily tradingvolume ADV, it might make sense to use an algorithm on the ETF sharesto participate at levels where the market is trading or to use other methods.In an ETF in which there is low ADV, an algorithm on the underlying basketenables you to participate with the actual volumes of the constituent shares.This is a great way to achieve the hidden liquidity because you are trading thecomponents, and the execution desk can give you the interpolated shares andprice for the ETF. This is a critical use of the underlying basket to eliminatelarge spreads due to low trading volumes and the other costs associated withrisk markets or using brokerage balance sheets to create volume in an ETFat suboptimal times.As with market or limit orders, algorithms can always be used goingboth ways in either the ETF or the basket. Many times people do not seemas worried about getting into an ETF position as they are about gettingout. If a market event prohibits trading in equities, then everything will beaffected universally. But if the equity markets are trading, you can exit yourETF position via a market or limit order or via use of an algorithm all thesemethods can be used for either the ETF or its underlying basket.The fact that ETFs trade on an exchange like an equity security is reallyan added bonus to their liquidity structure. Every day APs can create orredeem shares in the ETF, achieving NAV pricing and liquidity. If you donot want to wait for that closing print, you can trade in the market. If itis an emergency and you want to sell ETF shares regardless of the price,then some LP will be willing to buy the shares at some level in relation tothe underlying basket. In extreme situations, all markets get irrational andmany market correlations move toward one. It would be irrational to thinkthat spreads would stay the same in those situations. A base expectationfor ETFs is that there will still be LPs in the products pursuing arbitrageand keeping discounts reasonable. That expectation was satisfied during themarket dislocation of late .P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONRISK MARKETS UTIL IZ ING BROKERDEALER CAPITALSome of the largest facilitators of the ETF order flow over the last decadehave been the brokerdealer desks. They have been facilitating order flowfor the institutional client base since the beginning of ETF issuance in themids. I built the ETF trading business at Bear Stearns in  as anoffshoot of the index arbitrage trading desk within the equity derivativesdepartment. The main feature of our business at the time was utilizing firmcapital to provide risk markets to our clients in the ETFs. Our sales pitchwas extremely simple. If you asked us for a market in an ETF, regardless ofwhat the screens were showing, we would provide prices at which you cantrade in real time. Once the client had traded, it was our problem to hedgeour risk and exposures. This was a clear outgrowth of the typical businessof equity block facilitation that the large institutional clients were used toand that brokerdealers were accustomed to providing. The difference inthis case was that the trading desk actually was able to hedge itself using afully fungible product. In a typical block facilitation, a brokerdealer mightsell a large amount of shares to a client and then work itself out of the shortposition over a number of weeks with a rough hedge. The desks would callall their other clients to find a seller and therefore offset their risk and makesome money in the process.In ETFs, the marketmaking process is different. As a trader making risk markets to clients, the minimum goal should be to close out therisk with a flat profitloss and keep the commissions that the client pays.Since an ETF has a fungible underlying basket, if you made a sale toa client, in many cases you are able to buy the underlying basket at either flat or slightly cheaper, closing out your risk. It took a long time forclients, who are used to trading against natural order flow on the otherside, to realize the new realities of the ETF marketplace. They were nolonger as important in providing offsetting liquidity. They could call inalmost any name at any time and the desk would be willing to makea market regardless of whether it had been trading the ETF with otherclients.ETFs actually leveled the playing field for clients in many ways becausethe brokerdealer desks had no information advantage by trading versusthe order flow. Everyone started trading to flat risk positions, and volumesgrew steadily. This also drove spreads lower because the business becamecommoditized very quickly. If I were a client and I typically traded with BearStearns because I knew it handled a lot of flow in the stock I was interestedin, with the ETF, it did not matter. Lehman would have the same basketP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution trading system as Bear, and I could take my trades there if Lehman wouldmake a tighter market.The mechanics of a risk market are reasonably simple. It now boilsdown to speaking to the desks with the most capabilities. Order flow rarelycrosses between two natural clients. Here is an example You are a buyerof , shares of the financials ETF. You call the ETF trading desk andask for a market or an offer in , shares. The difference is that youcan ask for a market, which does not let the desk know whether you will bebuying or selling. Or you can ask for an offer, which lets the desk know thatyou will be buying. By asking for a market, the desk stands ready to buy orsell at its prices, whereas by making an offer, it is only willing to sell. Say thedesk offers , shares at , and you agree to buy those shares. It willthen print the ETF trade on the consolidated ticker tape. Then it needs tohedge its position. Since you have bought, the trading desk has sold you theshares. It could have been selling you a piece of a long position in the ETFand therefore have nothing to do, but most likely it is selling you the ETFshort and will go and hedge its position. In order to hedge the exposure,it will make a decision as to whether the most profit is via the basket orfrom actually buying the ETF in the marketplace or some other hedge. Ithas taken the risk that the market could move in the interim between thetime you agreed to the trade and when it is able to secure a hedge for itsnew position. You have transferred the risk of market impact to the tradingdesk for which you will pay commissions and usually a slight premium tothe ETF value.Costs of R isk MarketsTypically, desks charge clients for offering risk in two ways either via thespread embedded into the price or via the commission. If the charge is builtinto the spread, it means that they are making your market at a price at whichthey can hedge the position while locking in some amount of profit versus theprice at which they sold the ETF shares. If they are charging a commission,the basic assumption should be that the spread they are making versus thehedge should be smaller because they will be compensated for some of theirrisk. The commission for a trade where a firm commits risk capital will behigher than for an agency transaction.The price of a risk market will always include the implied costs to doingthe trade. Thus, it will include a piece of the risk of slippage in the marketduring the interim until the hedge is secured, and it will include the otherbasic costs of facilitating the ETF trade the financing costs of partial CUsand creation or redemption CR fees.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONA simple look at where the spread would come from in an ETF marketis presented next. All pricing is based on the basket price.Bid Side of an ETF Market  Bid Side of Basket  CR FeeCU Slippage margin  Expected FinancingOffer side of an ETF Market  Offer Side of Basket  CR FeeCU Slippage Margin  Expected FinancingIf the basket is closed, and therefore not relevant to pricing at the time ofthe ETF trade, the value of the correlating hedge will be substituted in placeof the basket price in the equation. The expected financing is a function ofhow long the position potentially could be on the books of the firm makingthe market. This is dependent on the ADV of the ETF and the size of the CU.Once that estimate of time is made, financing would be determined by thecosts of maintaining the position, inclusive of management fees, borrowingfees, and trading fees of the hedge.Typically, the main brokerdealer ETF desks dealt with the institutionalclient base of the firm. The main equity or equity derivatives sales forcehandled order flow from their client base. In order to have access to thoserisk markets that were predicated upon using the firms balance sheet toapply capital, you had to be a covered account. But again, the world is adifferent place from just a few years ago, and the change has been drastic.Partially as a result of the rapid growth in the number of ETFs, it becameimpractical for many trading desks to be able to cover and make markets inall the products. They did not want to turn client business away, however,and it is impractical, in the heat of the trading day, to expect clients to knowwhich ETFs they could call the desk for and which they could not.The ETF trading desks also started interacting with the LPs and theETF flow aggregators to be able to offer access to all the various products.The barrier to entry in that market was the fact that they had to beparticipants, sometimes providing markets as well as taking liquidity out.Now it is possible to access the risk markets of the main brokerdealersvia the aggregators or other intermediary trading desks. The old specialistfirms are now also running upstairs proprietary marketmaking desks thatnot only trade and make markets electronically but also are willing toprovide largeblock markets to clients that they can access either directlyor via the aggregators. Just a few years ago, it might have been impossiblefor clients in the wealth management division of a brokerdealer to accesslargeblocksize liquidity. Now, if they follow the proper path, they can getlargeblock markets in all of their ETF order flow.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution CREATIONS AND REDEMPTIONSThe creation and redemption process is at the heart of the ETF productwrapper. Openended issuance, as the process of daily creations is called,enables ETFs to grow to accommodate demand. Then, when demand reverses and the underlying are no longer in demand, Authorized ParticipantsAPs are able to redeem positions. This is one of the reasons that ETFs tendto trade within a tight band around their NAV. The forces of supply anddemand are manageable with this justintime inventory process.There is a massive amount of confusion among the ETF client base aboutthe creation and redemption process. For many years, the CR process hasbeen advertised as the way to access the hidden underlying liquidity in theETFs. While it is true that the liquidity is from the underlying basket, it isa mistake for clients to think they are actually doing creations and redemptions. The CR process is basically just the backoffice functionality thatenables APs to manage their positions on the trading books. It allows trading desks to be more aggressive in making markets and providing liquidity.The APs have registered with the issuers to deal on the primary market on adaily basis. They are providing the liquidity, either via executing a basket forthe client or trading in the ETF, and cleaning up their positions with either acreation or redemption. Clients are able to achieve an NAV execution plusor minus small fees. But clients are not doing the creationredemption theyare having it done on their behalf. What makes this distinction so importantThe semantics are important because many clients think the creation processrestricts them to certain sizes that they must do in order to gain access toa specific ETF. Although that may have been true several years ago, in thecurrent world, there are plenty of providers who are willing to aggregate theorder flow, so clients can get NAV executions in almost any size they desire.You can see from Exhibit . that the client and the issuer will alwayshave the AP between their transactions. Because of this, it is not actually theclient who is restricted by the amount of shares in the CU. The restriction toCU size was imposed on clients over the years from APs. APs did not wantresidual pieces of ETFs and baskets sitting on their books, accruing financingcosts. If a client wants to get into , shares of an ETF at NAV and theETF creation unit size is , shares, then somewhere the , extrashares will have to be accounted for, positioned, and financed. APs can buythe underlying basket equivalent to , shares of the ETF and sell theETF to the client. In order to flatten the position on the trading books, theywould then process a creation order, delivering the basket to the issuer andreceiving ETF shares. But this has to be in ,ETFshare equivalents,so in order to remain hedged, they would have to buy more baskets first orsell out the extra ETF shares in the marketplace.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTION.

Steps of an AgencyBased Creation OrderWe must remember that the goal of LPs or APs is to effect the transferof assets between the issuer and the client without using up balance sheetor taking directional market risk. Everything they do in this regard mustbe perfectly hedged. The financing cost is what many people miss in thepositioning, and it is important to understand when attempting to judge thecosts of the transaction. Where the AP is short the ETF to the client and longthe basket to facilitate an , share order, it is financing both sides of apotentially large notional amount. In the other scenario where the AP doesthe creation, it is financing a much smaller position of the residuals, ,ETFs, and the corresponding baskets.The cost of financing is embedded in every ETF trade. In very liquid ETFs, where the LP would be able to unwind the residual positionsin the marketplace, the financing costs would be very small. In lowervolume ETFs, the financing costs of residual positions, either from processingpartial creations and redemptions, or providing liquidity into the marketplace, can be quite high because the positions consume precious amounts ofbalance sheet.In addition to the costs of financing residual pieces of CR trades, thereis also a fee for doing a creation or redemption. Issuers charge managementfees already. This additional fee is a processing fee levied by operationsmanagement companies for moving stocks and ETFs around and movingmoney on the other side. Essentially it is a ticket charge. The size of this fee istypically a function of the number of stocks in the underlying basket and thecomplications involved in tradingpositioning those stocks. A stock basketcomprised of Indian local securities typically will have a higher CR feethan a U.S. domestic fund, along with higher local brokerage commissions.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution This fee is also translated into the spread of every ETF trade. The potentialfinancing costs for maintaining residual positions of ETFs and baskets willalso be factored into spreads.It is important to understand these fees because they will drive thepricing of your NAVbased transaction my preferred name for a clientdriven creation or redemption. You can expect to receive the ETF at NAVplus small additional fees that will drive the cost slightly higher. Last, therewill be commissions on the transaction by the AP. There is no standardizedfee setup for an NAVbased transaction. Some are calculated around basispoints of notional, others are a pershare charge, and still others consider itto be a mechanical operational procedure and levy a flat fee.Three main costs are embedded in the pricing of an NAV transactionand are built into spreads. Financingstamp taxes on positions. Local brokerage commissions. Creationredemption feesSince there is no systematic NAV crossing network for ETFs, the endinvestor pays all the fees all the time. There has been some earlystage discussion about creating a onceaday NAV cross for ETFs. Then the end userwould not pay the financing costs of residuals because they could potentiallybe eliminated. This would also be done outside the processing firms, thuseliminating the payment of the CR fees. It would be useful for cleaning upshare sizes that are smaller than actual creation units.NAV Crossing MechanismA big step in the direction of solving the dilemma of potentially low tradingvolumes in new ETFs and in those products that are not intended as tradingvehicles would be the establishment of some form of ETF NAV crossingfacility. The brokerage community is attempting to devise ways to executebaskets of underlying constituents on an agency basis for clients facilitatingthe use of the ETF regardless of its intraday trading volume. The next logicalstep would be to devise a crossing mechanism to cut down on unnecessaryexcess trading. Gary Gastineau, a legendary force in the world of ETFs, hasreferred to this concept in a recent article. Gastineau writes about tradingand the trading costs of ETFs, many details of which are covered throughoutthis book. He refers to an NAV cross as a way to reduce the costs of trading.When he mentions an NAVtype cross, Gastineaus consideration is thereduction of fees, while I think it becomes even more valuable in facilitatingvolume in lowvolume ETFs in general. Also, if you have an ETF with anP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONextremely difficult basket of underlying constituents, an NAV cross canpotentially reduce the need for an LP to act as an intermediary. Althoughthere might be no initial guarantee of an execution in a basic cross structure,there is always the potential that the mechanism will develop in ways thatwill enable LPs to facilitate on the opposite side of imbalances to provide ahigher hit rate of executions.This NAV cross is already happening in the mutual fund world becausethe process is based around buying and selling fund shares for cash at NAV.It is a certainty that a mutual fund manager faced with the delivery of and the payment of  from two opposing clients is doing nothing inthe portfolio. In the ETF structure, those two orders are most likely beingfacilitated at different points in the exchange mechanism. An article onIndex Universe recently announced that db xtrackers is offering clients theability to trade at the official net asset value NAV for all  of its exchangetraded funds listed on the London Stock Exchange. The article goes on toexplainIts most important impact, however, may be as a way to levelthe playing field between smaller, lessestablished ETFs and large,more liquid alternatives. Often, investors hesitate to buy ETFs withrelatively low assets and trading volumes for fear of illiquidity. Theyare concerned that they will pay too high a spread, or that a largeorder will impact the price of the ETF, or that they will be unableto exit an ETF during a down market. With NAVbased trading,they will at least be assured a certain level of price accuracy.This can and should be done in the U.S. markets. When a process likethis is rolled out into the entire universe of ETFs, the game will most certainlychange drastically for everyone involved.NAV TradingThe market is evolving to a synthetic NAV trading model. In this model,portfolio desks will use ETF baskets and apply their algorithms with thecreationredemption process in the background to flatten positions. In thismodel, internationalbased ETFs are utilized to provide liquidity to the clientbase without the additional costs of riskbased liquidity spreads and premiums and discounts related to sentiment as opposed to actual market behavior. The ETF IIV is valuable when attempting to determine a price to placean order in a domestic U.S. ETF that is not time sensitive. If you are using asecond lag on pricing for a position anticipated to be in a portfolio for anextended time period use one day minimum as a base, it becomes irrelevantP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution if you get filled at an IIV level from  seconds ago. If you are not tradingnews, intraday market activity should not affect your trading. Additionally,beyond the realm of domestic U.S. ETFs, into the international underlyingbaskets, the IIV is almost a useless number for trading. It should be disregarded by investors as stale no matter how frequently it updates during theday. I expect that the major data providers will be calculating and sellingestimated NAV numbers that will incorporate a correlation indicator toestimate the moves expected of the underlying basket and produce a numberthat indicates where the ETF should be trading eNAV.Many of the major trading firms are already calculating an eNAV inorder to provide liquidity in the various ETFs. Eventually it should be provided to clients to aid in their execution. As of the final editing of this book,one of the largest ETF providers is in the process of teaming up with anexecutiononly brokerdealer who will provide realtime IIV data for theU.S.listed funds and utilize algorithms to define ETF pricing levels for theplacement of limit orders. This is just the beginning.Estimating IIV is necessary for a fund in which the underlying basketis not trading during the same hours as the ETF. Typically, this is donewith a correlation proxy used to adjust the IIV to account for recent marketmovements.The basic calculation for the estimated net asset value was presented inChapter  and iseNAV  Shares per each component stock Last Local PriceForeign Exchange Rate   xCreation Unit Shares Estimated CashCreation Unit Shareswhere x  the expected percentage change in the underlying constituents.A great way to ease liquidity concerns is to shift the execution ofmany ETFs to the underlying baskets in the appropriate time frames andinterpolate that trading back to the ETFs for a client portfolio. I expect theprogram trading desks to expand on that in coming years to handle thegrowing onslaught of ETF business. Although many of the ETF productswere access based and valuable only with a tremendous amount of intradayvolume originally, many products are now investment based. Those products provide performance versus a specific benchmark and are not intendedto be used as intraday trading tools, so the ability the trade the underlyingbasket and interpolate that into the ETF is critical for their development.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONSpreadsThe cost to trade ETFs has been a hotly debated topic in the industry sincetheir inception. It would be remiss of this handbook to completely ignorespreads. I will spend only a small amount of space, however, on them. MattHougan discusses several of the costs of trading ETFs and some of theirpotential causes in the Guide to Exchange Traded Funds. He highlightsseveral studies demonstrating a high inverse correlation between size of fundin AUM and the spread and depth of market. He ends by saying Spreadsshould be incorporated into every ETF trading decision, much the way thatbrokerage commissions are. Their impact will be felt most by the shorttermtraders, but even longterm investors should consider their planned holdingperiod and incorporate spreads into their trading decisions.I agree with Hougan that spreads are a cost of trading ETFs. We are,however, discussing methods of trading that dramatically reduce the spreadissue. If you are trading a highfrequency or other type of statistical arbitragestrategy, spreads are incredibly important. But if you are moving outside thatrealm and using ETFs as an investor, you can eliminate many of the negativecharacteristics associated with wide spreads by proper ordertype use andutilizing the openending issuance function to achieve NAVstyle executions.Proper execution of ETFs can bring the costs of spreads down to a rootproblem that now affects all stock trading. Stock spreads in general havewidened and depth of book has decreased in the current market regulatoryregime. The problem with spreads is not actually in the ETF but in theunderlying basket from which their price is derived.To take that argument one step further, I would point out that thestructural component of inkind stock transactions of the ETF do even moreto diminish the negative impact of spreads. In an ETF, if you have givenan order to buy the basket with the purpose of achieving an implied NAVexecution, you will bear the costs of the spreads of the underlying stocks.The AP will then deliver the underlying stocks to the issuer at the closingprice. The ETF will not pay any spread. This is an example of how the ETFstructure pushes execution costs down to the individual investor for theinvestment. In a mutual fund, when there is a large creation or redemptionand a basket is traded, that pricing goes into the fund and is funneled to theentire population of fund holders.In one of his concluding lines, Hougan states Especially for newerETFs with low assets under management, investors would do well to payattention to spreads when they trade to avoid paying too much above fairvalue. This is absolutely true for the plain vanilla domestic equity ETFs. Ifyou go beyond those products, on many occasions, fair value is based onprice estimations of where the underlying instruments might be accessible.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution In many cases, what is considered to be a spread is actually an estimate ofactual value, including the costs of execution. You might look at the ETF asa passthrough vehicle to the underlying assets You should be looking at thecosts of trading those underlying assets instead of the ETF. The importantpiece often missed is how the liquidity in the underlying baskets is accessed.When a LP is making a risk market in an ETF that has a basket that is nottrading at the same time, the customer is paying for potential risk associatedwith tracking error of the hedge. The customer is buying the ETF at a pricebased on the LPs estimated value of the ETF. If the customer considers theETF to be trading at a cheap price compared to his or her own estimatedvalue of the ETF, then the spread can be working in the customers favor,no matter how wide it is.EXAMPLES OF EXECUTIONS IN THE MARKETIn this section, we go through several examples of executingETF order flow. There are millions of examples of what not todo and great examples of when executions work out perfectly.I have tried to utilize examples that demonstrate what happensin a particular situation and how it might have gone better or worse.Example  A Market Order Sent E lectronica l lyin a LowVolume ETFA market order sent in a very liquid security in small size will most likely beexecuted at the National Best Bid or Offer. In an extremely liquid security,a market order can do well to satisfy execution needs.In a lowvolume ETF, however, the results can be extremely costly inrelation to where a trade may have occurred if liquidity had been sourcedcorrectly. Exhibit . shows the results for a market order that is sent in alowvolume ETF. The ETF typically trades approximately , shares perday and the market order was to buy , shares. It is a unique situationthat a market order was sent at  times the daily average volume. It istypical, and a testament to the structure, that on any given day, an order for times the daily average volume can take place in a lowvolume ETF.In this case, the market order took approximately  seconds to get filledand moved the price almost  from its initial onscreen market prices.The bubble graph in Exhibit . shows the amount of shares bought ateach level represented by the size of the bubble.

At no point does it stopto wait and see if any more shares will come in to fill in the order book.Market orders are based on speed of execution regardless of price. Theyhave a valuable place in the ordertype spectrum but can be a very dangerousweapon if not utilized properly by investors.Example  A Large Risk Marketand Agency Creat ionIn Exhibit ., you can see a twominute picture of the tape on a day inAugust .

The price of the trade is merely  basis points abovethe most recent offer price of .. Although it cannot be seen from theillustration, the size of the offer at that time was  shares, and the ETFhad a daily average volume of less than , shares at the time. In thisscenario, a customer called up an LP and asked for a risk offer in the ETF.Upon agreeing on the price, the trade was printed to the consolidated tape.This trade was  times more than the daily average volume of the ETF. Tofacilitate this trade, the market maker achieved exposure via the currencymarket to hedge the portfolio and then processed a creation to flatten outits short position in the ETF and its hedge.At the time of this trade, the customer also gave an AP an order tobuy an additional  million notional of this same ETF benchmarked toNAV. In order to satisfy this order, the AP would do a creation. This is anagency creation on behalf of the client order underlying it. It is important tounderstand the distinction between the agency creation and the risk marketbecause it highlights an interesting technique by the client. The customerpositioned onethird of his or her desired size immediately by using a riskmarket. The client paid a slight premium versus the market for the use ofthat firm capital. Then he or she achieved the rest of the exposure via thecreation process, which should equate to a price close to NAV of the fund.In this scenario, the ETF had AUM of  million when the customerplaced the orders. The day after the creations had been processed, the fundP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution would have AUM of  million because the customer effectively doubledthe size of the ETF. At the same time, the customer, who was concernedabout potentially owning  of the funds outstanding shares, was comfortable with owning only  of those shares once the creations were completed. This is an excellent method for achieving exposure. If you are notsensitive to intraday price movements of the ETF, waiting for an overnightexecution via the underlying constituents can give you the exposures youwant without an impact on the market. If the customer went to the LP witha request for a market in the whole size, he or she would have had a greaterimpact because the price offered would have been further away from themarket as quoted. In this case, the customer was able to secure onethirdof the position immediately, therefore participating somewhat in any pricemove between the time of trading and close of business in the underlyingconstituent market.Example  A Basket Trade Executed OvernightIn this example, the customer wanted to gain exposure to the Japanesemarkets via an ETF that trades in the United States. Since an internationalETF trading during the U.S. trading day is a price discovery vehicle forattempting to determine where prices would be trading when the marketnext opens, the customer decided to use the underlying basket for achievingthe exposure and to receive a report in the ETF the next day. It is important tonote that even though the customer is not paying the premium or discountfrom price discovery, he or she is assuming the risk of market move bywaiting for the overnight execution.The customer places an order with an ETF trading desk, which is also anAP, to buy the basket underlying the ETF at the volume weighted averageprice in Japan overnight. At the end of trading, the AP will calculate theimplied price of the ETF from the basket executions, add in the appropriatecharges for creation fees, brokerage costs, and commissions, give the customer an ETF price and share amount, and then print the trade to the tape.In Exhibit ., a few things should be highlighted. The trade prints tothe tape at  am, before the market opens for trading. The trade priceEXHIB IT .

This can also be seen inthe conditions printed with the trade. Since this is the first trade on the tapefor that trading day, there have not been , other shares that couldhave been traded at various prices to make up the average price, furtherconfirming that this was probably a trade done based on the underlyingbasket traded in the local market.This trade did not put the trading desk at risk because the customerdid not ask for a market. Therefore, there is no risk premium attached tothe trade that made it more expensive. By trading the underlying basketof the ETF, the customer was trading the ETF in NAV terms, with justcosts attached, removing the variability of the price discovery mechanism ofpremiums and discounts that can occur during the U.S. trading day.CONCLUSIONIn summary, the best practices for executing order flow in the ETF markets are Place a limit order. Limit orders are most effective when they are placedin relation to the IIV of the ETF with domestic underlyings or in relationto an eNAV when trading an ETF where the underlyings are not tradingat the same time as the basket. When doing so, you should be cognizantof where the ETF should be trading. Ask for a risk market from a liquidity provider. If you are an institutionalinvestor or an advisor, you have access to the ETF liquidity providersfor risk markets. If you are a client of a large brokerdealer, all brokerdealers have ETF trading desks that are in the business of committingcapital for block trades or facilitating NAVbased executions. If you arein a wealth management business, you probably would have to directyour intermediary trading desk to get you a risk market from either itsLP relationships or from a liquidity aggregator. Work the order using an algorithm. You can use any algorithm on eitherthe actual ETF shares or the basket of constituents. See the algorithmsection of this chapter for some possible constraints when using thesetypes of orders. Have an Authorized Participant process an NAVbased transaction. Ifyou are happy to be based on the closing prices, this will produce aprice at NAV. If you have the AP utilize an algorithm of some sort totrade the basket throughout the day, this will provide an execution atan implied NAV price. This does not have to be in creation unit sizebut will involve trading the underlying basket and interpolating thoseexecutions into ETF shares.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeExecution Having trading desks and liquidity providers utilize the creation andredemption feature and other functionality of the ETFs is very importantin the efficient execution of ETF order flow. Customers can take advantageof this unique ability to grow and reduce shares outstanding. They benefitfrom it once they understand how it works. Although ETF providers havemade tremendous efforts get this information to their client base, the rapidadoption by new users means that the education process must be continuedand advanced. Many issuers have been building up their sales forces on theeducational side to teach clients best practices on execution for their ETForder flow. This saves clients money and enables them to move further downthe curve of available products. Utilizing ETFs that may be showing lessaverage daily trading volumes but offering different exposures is changingthe way that investors manage their portfolios.With the advances in electronic trading, the growth in the businesses ofproviding liquidity, and the education and adoption by the investing world,use of the broader range of ETFs is growing. There is room in the businessfor additional LPs to handle the growing number of available products. Andthere is room for ETF execution to evolve in ways to further reduce costsand improve efficiency of executions.In Chapter , the final chapter, we meet current market participantsin the ETF trading world. We examine the roles of the different players andhow we can best interact with them in the marketplace. We also look atsome of their trading strategies to better understand their goals.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeCHAPTER Market Participants and TheirTrading StrategiesI n the early days, the specialists were the primary liquidity providers LPsin exchangetraded fund ETF products. They facilitated order flow thatwas customer driven, flowing through the brokerdealers heading towardthe exchange floors. At some point in the late s, investment banksrealized there was money to be made intervening in and facilitating thisflow. Many of the positions in ETF trading have been taken up from therealm of index arbitrage, portfolio trading, or equities traders who havemigrated into the space over the years. It has been a learning experiencefor many firms this upstairs business has developed from almost nothing inthe mid to late s to become a very profitable source of revenue. Theprimary business of providing block and electronic liquidity has grown themost rapidly. This chapter describes the participants and interprets some oftheir primary behaviors. Knowing the motivations of your counterpart inthe markets will help you to get your ETF orders executed efficiently.The explosion of ETF block trading and order facilitation occurredwhen equity block trading revenues were beginning to show signs of declineat major investment banks. The banks developed desks covering the ETFproduct line and began to find ways to trade the products. In many ways,providing liquidity in ETFs is a combination of two trading methods that thebanks already did very well large block facilitation and basket trading. Takeblock traders and give them a way to truly hedge their positions by trading abasket of underlying stocks and you create a powerful revenue stream. Theinstitutions became early adopters of the process. Due to natural evolution,banks were able to generate revenue streams from all the corollary businessesaround the product as well. Also, this was a very profitable product line forspecialists on the exchange floors. Many of those early ETF traders havesince migrated to upstairs businesses, continuing to provide liquidity.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONWhen the institutional customer base got involved, it was because customers saw the opportunity to trade a futurestype product that was actuallya listed equity. It would enable them to hedge a large portion of their portfolio with relative efficiency. ETFs also provided institutional investors witha way of getting risk markets in the index space. Up until that point, onlya handful of futures existed and even fewer allowed block prints, and itwas rare to get capital commitment risk on index swaps. Hedge funds couldnow employ their trading strategies in the index space, and ETFs quicklyamassed a fan base with large amounts of capital. Customers were used toexecuting large blocks of stocks via institutional desks at investment banksso they naturally started sending ETF flow through those desks. The desksrealized that if they traded the underlying basket they could hedge themselves efficiently, providing markets to their client base, and the business ofbeing a liquidity provider LP grew.I refer to the term liquidity provider rather than market makerbecause I consider the ability to hedge yourself with a realtime basket, essentially locking in a price differential at the time of trading, to be differentfrom making a market when hedging is more difficult. Depending on howthe domestic ETF is priced, there may be a small amount of risk in obtainingthe basket hedge, but essentially it is just balance sheet usage to facilitate aclient tradehence the name liquidity provider. It is also here where a lotof clients get confused about available liquidity. Taking only the ETF volumeand not the underlying basketinterpolated volume does not give you a valuable picture of the true liquidity of the product, as was discussed in Chapter. LPs are accessing this additional volume so that they can facilitate orderflow. This has created massive liquidity in some of the products.I consider there to be five unique forms of LPs, each interacting withETF order flow in a distinct manner in the market. There is some overlap,but I distinguish between them because they play different roles. The fivetypes are. Brokerdealer facilitation desks. Proprietary marketmaking firms. Lead market makers LMMs. Highfrequency trading firms. Liquidity aggregatorsReviewing the typical goals and roles of each of the participants will helpyou understand the ETF order flow food chain. We are going in no particularorder because many of the players act in different roles depending on marketcircumstances. Knowing the players enables investors to price orders moreefficiently and understand what might be happening when questions arise.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies BROKERDEALER FACIL ITATION DESKSThe biggest investment banks, which also have clearing departments andwealth management arms, typically have two areas that handle the facilitation of ETF order flow the institutional ETF trading desk and the intermediary trading desk. Some of the order flow can be handled by bothdesks, although not all can. Typically, discretionarybased order flow fromthe wealth management businesses cannot be facilitated with firm capitaland needs to be segregated out from the proprietary trading desks. Thisis discussed in further detail later in the section on intermediary tradingdesks.Inst i tut ional ETF Trading DeskThe institutional ETF trading desk is typically a feature of the equities orequity derivatives departments. It works in conjunction with the equityderivatives group, portfolio trading, and institutional sales. This desk typically handles all of the institutional customer businesses revolving aroundETFs. The main functions are Committing firm capital to facilitate block trades in the secondarymarket Dealing in the primary market doing creations and redemptions asAuthorized Participants APs Trading baskets for customers accessing the underlying ETF liquidity Facilitating stock loan inventory Trading custom basket and index swaps Trading and making block markets in optionsThe primary clientele of these desks traditionally has been the institutional community. This recently has been changing, however, as largeradvisors use the products and change the nature of order flow.The desks have been growing over the last few years as the requirementsof being a fullservice ETF desk have also evolved. In the late s, whenbuilding the desk at Bear Stearns, we were able to cover most trades withan international and a domestic trader. Now traders with knowledge ofthe different businesses of commodities and fixed income are also valuablebecause of all the different types of ETFs in the marketplace. The continuingemergence of new types of ETFs with a variety of underlying securities hasforced ETF desks to deal with many different areas throughout the firm tofacilitate customer business. Some of these desks also are adding their ownP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONETFspecific sales forces, a position that did not exist just a few years ago.This is a byproduct of a changing clientele some are focusing only on theETF product structure and are large enough to sustain an ETFdedicatedsales team.Chapter  presented suggested requirements for building a fullserviceETF trading business. The systems required are extensive. Beyond the typicalclient order management systems, there needs to be advanced realtimepricing systems and a group tasked with building and maintaining themodels for ETF pricing. There are currently more than  U.S.listed ETFs.Sophisticated systems are needed to bring in all the underlying securitiesand weights for each ETF and price them in real time so that markets can bepriced effectively. Staff members are needed to monitor corporate actions,index changes, and dividends. Then smart order routers and basket tradingsystems are needed to handle the hedging. Since the hedging is no longer justequities and future based, but can be bonds or commodities of wide variety,there also needs to be advanced risk management and position monitoringsystems that can handle all asset classes in multiple currencies and breakdown each ETF into its constituent parts. One of the most attractive featuresof being a trader on the institutional ETF trading desk is the diversity of potential experience. ETFs are a melting pot of asset classes and require tradersto bring together many parts of the firm that did not previously need tointeract or coordinate. The desk can be trading baskets of global securities,commodities, and bonds and interacting with a wide variety of playersthroughout the firm. The downside is the same many of the main tradingdesks have been unable to handle making markets in many new types ofETFs, leaving open the doors for product specialists to enter the markets.Since the ETF marketplace has exploded from next to nothing over thepast  years, so has the client base of the desk. Over the same time period, the institutional community has expanded rapidly as hedge funds haveproliferated. Some of the biggest businesses of the department focus on servicing the needs of these firms and facilitating large blocks of ETFs. Otherbig customers, passive accounts using ETFs for transitions, cash equitizations, and money management have also become significant clients of ETFdesks. In the future, we will continue to see the client base grow and evolveto include more sovereign wealth funds, k and Individual RetirementAccount platforms, financial advisors, and retail investors.Another feature of large brokerdealer ETF trading desks is facilitatingstock loan inventory. The current inefficiencies of the stock loan businessare astounding. The stock loan desk is typically part of the clearing business. Stock loan desks are not traditionally the firms risktaking desks, andthey do not typically maintain risk positions. The stock loan departmentwould take the inventory of the firm positions and lend them to the Street,P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies attempting to optimize the balance sheet. In the ETF business, you can create inventory in order to lend it to the Street. These creations typically aredone on the ETF trading desk, and the positions are maintained on thatdesk. This situation enables ETF traders to better monitor the risk embedded in maintaining an ETF position versus its underlying basket, such asrebalances, corporate actions, and tracking error. The stock loan desk takesthose positions and lends them to the Street at a better rate than the costs tomaintain the positions, and the profits are split between the stock loan andtrading desks. The clearing clients who are forced to trade away from thefirms proprietary ETF marketmaking desk because of regulations regardingdiscretionary order flow and capital commitment are having their borrowrequirements satisfied by similar competing trading desks. This creates aninteresting conundrum for the future growth of those businesses.The desks at the brokerdealers typically facilitate client flow on a proprietary basis. They make markets provide liquidity with firm capital forclients and handle agency flow, creations, and redemptions. As the clientbase grows to understand the benefits of using ETFs in the form of net asset value NAVtype transactions, either via algorithms on the basket orbenchmarking to the close, it is doing more business with large firms on anagency basis. This is also bringing the user base down the curve of availableETFs into the domain of those that show less average daily trading volumebut have plenty of underlying liquidity available via the underlying basket.Another major feature of brokerdealer institutional ETF trading desksis their ability as APs. ETF providers have entered into agreements withall the main ETF desks to enable them to transact in the primary issuancemarket utilizing the creation and redemption mechanism to maintain positions. Because the creation and redemption of ETFs is one of their mostimportant features, I consider this functionality of the desks primary to theirimportance in maintaining positions balanced both on the Street and on thebrokerdealer balance sheets. The main business of making large block markets in the ETFs would be riskier and costlier if they were unable to adjusttheir positions with the issuer at the end of each trading day. They can cleanup their balance sheet usage and move large assets onto the books of the ETFissuers, or vice versa. This keeps the ETF trading around NAV and enablesthe LPs to start each day with a clean sheet. Additionally, they are able toutilize this feature for the wide variety of financing trades surrounding theETF business.While the institutional ETF trading desk is handling most of the flowfrom the hedge fund and asset management client base in ETFs, providingthem with largesize risk markets on demand, clients of a firms wealthmanagement businesses are steering almost all of their order flow toward anintermediary an agencyonly internal trading desk.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONIntermediary Trading DeskThe clientele of the intermediary trading desk has evolved with the adoptionof the ETF product line. As recently as a few years ago, if you were situated ina wealth management or private client services department of a large brokerdealer, you would not speak to the institutional ETF trading desk. Even now,some large ETF trading desks cannot speak to intermediary trading desksthat handle order flow from the brokerage and advisory businesses. But theadoption of ETFs and the generation of large block ETF order flow arechanging the nature of the order flow from wealth management businesses.Access to the desk typically is determined by whether the customer businessis discretionary or nondiscretionary. Most order flow from the advisorybusinesses is kept segregated within the prime brokerage business and runsthrough the intermediary trading desk. Typically the advisory businesses donot have a relationship with the inhouse ETF trading desk. In a multifacetedfirm with a wealth management platform and with a large ETF tradingdesk that facilitates a tremendous amount of ETF flow for the institutionalclient base, a large advisory group transacting in ETFs cannot always accessthe liquidity of the ETF desk. In many cases the advisory group speaks tothe intermediary desk, and that desk goes outside the firm to source ETFliquidity.The intermediary desk has had to learn how to access liquidity in theETF product line. Historically intermediary desks handled agencybasedorder flow, which they would take directly to the floors or, more recently, todark pools and internal crossing engines. Now the advisory businesses haveembraced the ETF product, and are pushing farther down the product curve.They do not want to be restricted to using the top  of available ETFsbecause they are not only using ETFs for basic beta exposure. They want tobe able to access the product that can fit into the alternative alpha categoriesas well. The volumes in these products are lower, but the underlying basketsstill provide liquidity if they can be accessed, and the client base is pushingto use more of those products.The accessing of the liquidity takes place primarily through the use ofexternal LPs and market makers or liquidity aggregators. In many cases,the situation arises where an intermediary trading desk sourcing liquiditythrough an LP is transacting against its own brokerdealer for the otherside of the trade. The regulations have unwittingly created a situation wherea middle player needs to intermediate between an ETF trading desk andthe firms own client base, which inevitably adds fees that are borne bythe end client. I consider the regulations regarding discretionary order flownot receiving firm capital to be outdated because of the advances in riskmanagement now available via technology.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies AdvisorBased Order F low In a situation where a large advisor on oneof the major platforms wants to transact a large order in an ETF, some ofthe next situations can arise. The advisor typically is restricted to callingthe intermediary trading desk with the order. Since this type of large ETFbusiness is new to traders on intermediary desks, there may be uneven resultsand nonstandardized practices, depending on who picks up the phone. Themost unfortunate result is when a large ETF order comes to the desk in anETF that does not trade a lot of intraday daily volume. The trader on thedesk may reject the order back to the advisor who generated it, saying thereis no way to transact in that large size in this illiquid ETF. That is perhapsthe worst answer that can be provided and displays the need to furthereducate the trading desks regarding the underlying liquidity of ETFs. Thefact that, unlike a stock, there is always a LP ready to provide a market inan ETF based on estimated net asset value eNAV needs to be universallyunderstood.The best scenario is when intermediary trading desks have relationshipswith many of the LPs and aggregators in the marketplace and take all theirETF volume to those service providers. Because of the large number of available ETFs, LPs often develop specialties in certain products, internationalfunds, and commodities. The savvy desks will have a roster of LPs to usedepending on what type of fund is being traded. Additionally, the liquidityaggregator will be able to call up several LPs at once, speaking directlywith the specialty traders to get pricing in the requested names. Typically,LPs and liquidity aggregators who are called can provide immediate pricingin blocks of ETFs. This does not, however, solve the issues of clients whowould prefer to have their order flow worked in the underlying marketvia the basket and receive an NAVbased execution. In order to do this,intermediary trading desks need a relationship with a portfolio trading orfullservice ETF desk that can provide creation and redemption style orNAVbased services as well.I have compiled two order flow diagrams to display how the flow isworking for the advisor community. Exhibit . focuses on nondiscretionary or transactionbased order flow. Because of the nondiscretionarynature of this order flow, some is allowed to go directly to the institutionalETF trading desks at the large firms. This is highlighted by the dotted lineshown from the order box to the fourth box down detailing sourcing liquidity from the ETF desk or outside liquidity sources. There are generallydifferent firmspecific internal rules about order flow that advisors mustunderstand in order to process their orders.In Exhibit ., we can see the flowchart for order flow based ondiscretionary account business. This type of order flow usually cannotinteract with the inhouse institutional desk because of compliance reasons.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeORORORNondiscretionaryTransactionalBased OrderExchangeThe LP submits a creationorder to the Issuer.Leading to the issuance ofnew ETF shares.Both of these tradesare printed to theconsolidated tape sothey show up as tradesbut are not reallyexecuted on theexchange.Order typically less than ,shares gets sent electronicallyto the exchanges for execution.Providing a NAV execution would havethe LP buying the underlying basket andselling the ETF to the client at the impliedexecution price.Making a risk market in the ETF wouldhave the LP selling the ETF to the clientand hedging by buying the underlyingbasketIntermediary Trading Desk will contact aLiquidity Provider LP, or the inhouseETF Desk to pursue alternative liquidityoptions, either risk market or NAVexecution.Intermediary Trading Desk will work theorder on the exchange and potentiallyuse algorithms.Orders greater than , sharesshould get called into the intermediarytrading desk for execution.

They can be proprietary arbitrage desks, market makers and LMMs,statistical arbitrage, and highfrequency trading firms. According to some accounts, electronic trading firms provide more than  of the average dailyvolume in U.S. equities. Because of the unique structure of ETFs in particular, these firms provide a tremendous amount of liquidity in the products,with some trading exclusively in the ETFs.Proprietary Arbitrage DesksBusinesses that focus on capturing spreads between the ETF and the respective underlying baskets are performing a trading strategy called proprietaryarbitrage. These businesses can be either standalone trading firms that haveraised money from a client base or desks within large investment banks trading firm capital. The businesses are focused on pricing out the underlyingbasket of the ETF and trading it versus the actual ETF shares. They arenot facilitating customer order flow they only are getting involved in tradesthat will reward them with a profit between the ETF and their respectivehedge. I consider this to be an expansion of the index arbitrage businessesthat used to focus only on the difference between futures and baskets ofstock. Over the last several years, there has been great growth in the numberof indexes available and the ETFs issued that track those indexes, creatingtremendous opportunities to arbitrage the spread between the two fungibleparts. It is difficult to determine what has caused the tremendous growth inthe business of statistical arbitrage trading the availability of these new arbitrage pricing spreads or the availability of technology fast enough to tradebaskets of stocks at incredible speeds. Most likely, it is a combination of thetwo. Volume has exploded in recent years in many ETFs as the result of thegrowth of the ETF arbitrage and statistical arbitrage trading businesses.A proprietary trading group is an LP but without an underlying sales andcommission structure. While the group is servicing a client base by providingliquidity, it is not dealing directly with those clients. LMMs sometimesmight interact with order flow at a less advantageous price to satisfy theminimum requirements of the position however, this occurs only becauseof the advantageous pricing scheme for LMMs. There are no fees being paidto a proprietary trading group by the market center beyond standard tradingP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies volume rebates. The group makes its money in profits. A LP in the form ofa proprietary trading group will be making markets electronically, hopingto interact with order flow as it comes into the system. It typically is pricingat different levels of profit depending on how much it wants to interact andhow much it wants to profit per trade. I consider proprietary trading groupsto be LPs because they are typically not hitting bids and taking offers butare being taken and hit by order flow that is coming into the marketplace.Because of order types with hidden size and the ability to do highspeedorder refresh and flashing, there is almost no way for liquidityseeking orderflow to determine how much liquidity is available at the different pricinglevels without testing each level with an actionable order.Current market structure has made minimal movements toward consolidating order flow onto one exchange to aid in available depth. This situationhas led to the proliferation of dark pools that further fragment the market. ALP is waiting for orders that typically have already screened against all othernatural customer order flow and are now flowing into the markets becauseof a favorable price limit or are market orders. Interaction can and shouldbe profitable this is why many firms have entered into the ETF marketplaceover the last several years.Hedging is of primary importance in this methodology. Although trading at the right price will be important for initiating the position, being ableto hedge yourself effectively and lock in your expected profit is what sets thedifferent participants apart. Much of this comes down to advanced systemsand some good analysis on correlation trading. In the domestic ETFs, profitsare a function of getting great execution in the basket or futures in real time.When moving into the international realm, profits are a function of havinga good hedge that correlates with your position and being able to unwindthat up and down position before financing eats away at your spread.Todays proprietary ETF marketmaking firms are some of the largestparticipants, in terms of number of traders and abilities. Brokerdealer trading desks have fewer traders covering a very broad number of ETFs. At theproprietary arbitrage shops, you will see more specialized traders coveringincreasingly smaller segments of the ETF market. These proprietary shopsare responding to order flow and therefore are focusing where the order flowis. These shops do better in names where there are fewer participants, widerspreads, and more opportunities for arbitrage. There is a delicate balancebetween a name having enough volume and wide enough spreads versussome of the names with incredible volume that are trading at spreads lessthan a tenth of a cent and, last, some names with wide spreads that do nottrade enough volume to be worthwhile. The arbitrage shops will be monitoring most, if not all, of the ETF market to respond to order flow in themarkets and requests for bids and offers.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONLead Market MakersI consider LMMs formerly known as specialists to be a subset of proprietary trading firms. In many respects, they are pursuing the same businessesarbitrage between the ETF and its respective basket. However, LMMs areregistered with the stock exchange in a partnership through which they agreeto meet minimum liquidity requirements for which they enjoy a modifiedfee structure. LMMs are there to provide basic levels of liquidity. This is avery different job from what specialists were doing before ETF trading wentelectronic. As exchanges have evolved, there are no longer definitive closeswhere all orders must get filled. The opening and closing prints were a bigpart of specialist fulfillment roles in the past.As previously discussed, in ETFs, specialists on the floor of the AmericanStock Exchange were the early profiteers in spreads between the ETF andits underlying, or the hedge. Much of the trading in the first several yearsof the ETFs was done on the floor of the exchange and facilitated by thespecialists. This was before Unlisted Trading Privileges made the actuallisting venue somewhat irrelevant. They had a time and place advantagethat enabled them to see all order flow and participate when appropriate.As that business changed and moved to electronic venues, those businessesmoved upstairs and became entwined with the proprietary arbitrage andcustomer facilitation desks. It is both less expensive and more flexible tohave traders on a trading desk than on a floor. In many cases there areadvantages to placing liquidity on multiple markets at once, eliminating theneed to be on one exchange.The most basic requirements of being an LMM are discussed in Chapter. LMMs typically are providing liquidity to the retail order flow that makesits way down to the exchanges via a variety of different order entry systems.One of the main tasks of LMMs is to be the LP of last resort for orderflow. LMMs are not obligated to completely fill all orders that come intothe systems, but they do have minimum requirements in terms of facilitationand market width and depth that must be met.The key to this role is that by satisfying the minimum requirements ofbeing an LMM, you inject some form of minimal liquidity for interactionwith the order flow coming through the pipes in exchange for a slightlymodified fee structure for trading. Recently, it has been debated in the marketplace whether the remuneration makes it worth being an LMM witheven the most minimal of requirements. In the ETF landscape, there is notenough in the requirements to help the neediest section of the ETF market,new issues. Additionally, in the case of many U.S.listed ETFs with domesticconstituents, the LMM requirements do not tie the ETF price to the IIVof the fund, which would potentially aid in the expansion of usage of thedomestic product set.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies Since we already understand that available liquidity is based aroundthe underlying basket of the ETF, in any ETF with domestic constituents,the investor base should be able to achieve liquidity via the basket at alltimes in a simple manner. This liquidity could be achieved by the exchangesin terms of requirements and remuneration for the LMMs or other LPsbut most likely will be provided by entrepreneurial trading houses seekingto expand their ETF order flow. Currently, the LMM markets, both sizeand price, are based around the low volume and wide spread of the newETFs. This makes little sense. A system that makes it valuable for LMMs tobe providing deeper and tighter markets in those ETFs that have availableunderlying constituents would help to incubate an expansion of the ETFmarket. This would make it cheaper for investors to trade the newer ETFsand would aid in ETF growth and development. It would also increase thevalue of these ETFs to LMMs. The role of LMM has been transformedfrom the old specialist system, but more can be done to rethink the role as apotential incubator of new products. Those products that grow quickly andattract a large following will not need to be attended by an LMM. However,sometimes they can be the most profitable products for an LMM. Productissuers and the exchanges have made several proposals to address some ofthese concerns. Only time will tell how the system evolves.HighFrequency TradingIn an ideal world, the price and liquidity of an ETF and its underlyingconstituents would match all the time. In practice, because of all the differenttypes of participants, the two separate assets hardly match in extremely shorttime spans. The highfrequency trading systems are trying to take advantageof that opportunity for profits.They are using models looking at volatility and expectations for futuremoves in order to scalp small amounts in incredibly small time periods, evendown to microseconds. However, because of the fungibility of the underlying basket and options and other derivatives on many ETFs, the productspresent a wide variety of different opportunities for trading strategies. Highfrequency players have become another liquidity source creating even morevolume in many ETFs. Their existence and growth highlights the diversityof product uses resulting in the greater development of the ETF business.The converging of many different trading styles into the same productsenables higher volumes and satisfies many different needs simultaneously.The presence of highfrequency players enables other players to utilize thevolumes they create to facilitate their own strategies, creating even more volumes. The strategy works well in ETFs because some players trade the ETFversus the underlying baskets or other available derivatives others are justP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONtrading available volumes utilizing tick anticipation strategies and still otherplayers are somewhat price insensitive, such as the investment community.Still others are trading to position for either hedging or performance. Thecoming together of all these players in the ETF enables them to feed off ofeach others differing strategies to create the perfect ecosystem for massivevolume growth. This situation is driving some of the growth we are seeingin the highvolume ETF products.L IQUID ITY AGGREGATORSBecause of the wide variety of ETFs in the marketplace, it has become verydifficult for trading desks to provide competitive markets in many of theproducts against customer order flow. However, they have a customer basethat is ever hungrier for the newer ETFs with the more arcane exposuresas sources of alpha for their portfolios. Many of the smaller orders flowto the exchange floors and can be satisfied by the electronic market makers, but there are still larger investors who need to be able to trade in sizesgreater than , shares. A newer liquidity ecosystem is developing tosatisfy this need for markets in the more arcane instruments. There havealways been interdealer brokers IDBs to facilitate flow between large brokerage houses to balance out exposures. They have now migrated to theETF space and expanded beyond just speaking to brokers to facilitatingclients directly as well. They typically facilitate the interchange of liquiditybetween a customerfacing trading desk and a proprietary marketmakingfirm or LMM. However, many have agreed with one or two LPs to makemarkets on request for their customer base. A firm with extensive relationships throughout the trading community has been very beneficial for theETF investor base. They work similar to a lending tree organization. Bycalling several LPs simultaneously for markets, aggregators cause them tocompete for access to the customer flow, thereby leading to tighter marketspreads with deeper size for ETFs. LPs have subscribed to the concept theyare happy to trade for slightly less spread in bigger size rather than not participate at all. From a customer perspective, you can get access to several LPsat once and get specifically to the LPs that might specialize in the producttype you are interested in trading. The matching up of client demand withavailable potential liquidity is a winwin situation.We have seen this form of evolution in ETF pricing and liquidity fromearly days. It leads inevitably to tighter available pricing in more size for theclient base. The ETF issuance stream and the customer base have recentlyeclipsed the growth of LPs, which has led to a smaller than desirable numberof trading firms providing liquidity in ETFs. More room for growth exists,P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies especially as the product investor base continues to expand in its desire tomove farther down the product curve to use less frequently traded and newerproducts. If the product pipeline continues unabated, there will be furtherdemand for bigger LPs or those that focus on industry niches.TRADING STRATEGIESThe growth of assets in ETFs would not have been possible or nearly assuccessful without the creation and redemption CR mechanism. In theintroduction to this book, I discussed features that distinguish ETFs fromtheir predecessor products, the mutual and closedend funds CEFs. The CRmechanism is the feature most responsible for ETF success. It is importantto remember that ETFs did not have firstmover advantage in the grandscheme of investment funds. Nor did they have firstmover advantage inthe listed funds world. CEFs offered certain similar exposures listed on U.S.exchanges long before ETFs. When a product comes into the marketplaceoffering similar exposures in a different and more efficient structure, it isthe structure that truly makes a difference. It is the unique structure of ETFsthat have enabled the product line to compete well against existing productleaders.I have seen this firsthand in my evolution from a CEF specialist intothe ETF trading arena and then even more closely from my perch inside aleading ETF issuer. A prime example of a niche where the ETF structurewas the late and last entrant to the marketplace but has become dominantis U.S.listed Indian exposure. In the particular example of India investmentproducts, you can see the entrance of two Investment Company Act of ETF products enter the market and successfully compete with longestablished CEFs and exchangetraded note products. You can also observehow the first ETF entrant has grown faster and larger than the second entranteven though they entered the space only weeks apart. The first mover is astrong determinant of success. A newer, more efficient structure can certainlyovertake older, less efficient vehicles.The CR mechanism has broadened the arbitrage trade between indexesand funds that previously existed in the marketplace in a very limited way.For many years, index arbitrage desks have monitored the spreads betweenthe main index derivative products, futures, and their underlying indexes.Limiting that business was the relatively small number of indexes that weretracked by futures, which reduced the number of potential arbitrage opportunities. The ETF, a product that acts like a listed future in a structuresimilar to an equity product, has brought an entirely new universe of tradable indexes to the marketplace. Now there is the potential to track everyP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONETF versus its underlying index and monitor those two separate yet fungibletrading products for arbitrage opportunities. Add to this the growth in thecorollary derivatives markets for options and singlestock futures, and yousee that the opportunities for arbitrage trading have increased exponentially.A long list of variables determines arbitrage success in ETFs. Differencesin financing rates, trading speeds, hedging techniques, and even pricing estimation enable a large number of different practitioners to coexist in thesame space. In the example of a straightforward U.S. domestic ETF, thecompetition to arbitrage between the basket and the ETF is dominated byspeed. The basket is trading in real time with the ETF, so you are able toprice and trade both products simultaneously. Since they are completelyfungible via the creation and redemption feature, it is a pure arbitrage trade.There is typically minimum financing embedded in the trade because youcan trade during the day and unwind after the bell on the same settlementcycle. You have the ability to trade the perfect creation unit so you haveno market exposure if you get complete execution on your order flow. Themain differentiating factor between two different pursuers of this strategy isspeed of processing and execution. It must be understood that, although anumber of trading firms monitor these arbitrage trades, the barriers to entryof capitalintensive infrastructure keep the number of APs limited to thosefirms willing and capable of investing in the required operations.Typically, the arbitrage opportunity appears when you can take advantage of a dislocation between the basket and the ETF because anothermarket participant executing some strategy either in the ETF or in one or allof the underlying stocks is not concerned about the relationship of these twoproducts. In many cases, the market participant could even be dependingon the efficiency of the arbitrage market to keep pricing in line. An examplewould be if there was a large outright buyer of a U.S. domestic ETF withtypically high intraday trading volume and a known presence of arbitragetraders the buyer could leverage the presence of the arbitrage players bybuying what liquidity becomes available in the ETF, assuming it is comingto market at prices relative to the underlying basket. I emphasize the wordrelative because the buyer is probably paying a small premium in themarketplace for the ETF, enabling the arbitrage players to profit. The buyeris in some ways unconcerned about that small spread because it is utilizingthe ETF for a different strategy or is unable to access an LP directly. Thisis almost always the result of less sophisticated order flow coming into themarketplace.I have coached execution firms in the past on developing business strategies in ETFs. They were sending ETF order flow to the exchanges in largeenough size to push prices far away from the underlying value. This processwas feeding the participating arbitrage community. While they recognizedP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies that they were feeding profits to the arbitrage community, they did not havethe capabilities in house to capture those spreads. Upon acquiring the required trading operations, they could trade their order flow more efficientlyand funnel those benefits to their client base in terms of better pricing.When dealing with plain vanilla ETFs, speed of execution is the differentiating factor more complex ETFs require more sophisticated systems tocapture arbitrage opportunities.Internat ional ETF ArbitrageWhen you look to do arbitrage between an ETF and its underlying basketof international stocks, there are many more factors to consider. First andforemost, an ETF trading during the U.S. market hours with a basket thatis closed during this time frame is acting as a price discovery vehicle for thefuture trading levels of the underlying basket. Since it is no longer reallyarbitrage if you are trading the ETF versus the value of a closed basket, thetechnique is to find a correlating asset or basket that has some relationshipto the ETF. Ideally you would be able to run a hour trading book inwhich you could trade the ETF versus the correlating hedge during U.S.hours and the correlating hedge versus the underlying basket during localmarket hours. This way you will be left with ETF versus the basket thatyou can flatten through the CR mechanism. The difficulttofind link isthe correlating hedge that trades during both time frames. Financing alsowill be involved, because you will not be unwinding your positions via theCR mechanism every night. Then there are the additional complicationsof trading in international markets, including currency exposures, taxation,and potential additional fees. And there is the slippage embedded in tradingtwo assets that are highly correlated but do not perfectly replicate eachother. Speed also will come into play if there are many players in the namesyou are monitoring. What can drive higher volumes in these trades are thedifferences in estimation of the IIV or eNAV. This was explained in detailin Chapter . The underlying basis of this trade is an estimation of whatyou think the fund eNAV will be at the time of trading, even though theunderlying basket is not trading. The ability to speculate on a closed basketmakes these ETFs so useful. Prior to their existence, such exposures werenearly impossible to achieve during U.S. trading hours. Those that wereavailable had greater risks owing to less efficient structures.It is important to understand the embedded risk between trading priceand basket value in an ETF with international underlying components. Andit is equally important to understand the real price implication of the premium or discount. If an ETF with a basket of Japanese stocks is tradingat a discount during the U.S. trading hours, it is not merely a function ofP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONbuying the ETF here and selling the basket in Japan using the redemptionprocess to capture the spread. If an ETF with Japanese underlying stocks istrading at a discount to IIV or eNAV during the U.S. trading day, it is notnecessarily showing an arbitrage opportunity. It is showing that traders ofthe ETF expect the Japanese market to open at a point lower than it closedthe previous night. The magnitude of the expected market move is where anarbitrage opportunity can arise in this situation.Lets take a simplified example to demonstrate this concept. In the example, you have developed a model, from backtesting and correlation studies,that shows a certain group of U.S.listed stocks that predict almost exactmovements in the Japanese basket of stocks that is replicated by ETF INTL.By watching the movement of that group of stocks, you can estimate wherethe market will be trading upon opening in the morning in Japan. Nowduring the U.S. trading day, that group of stocks is trading  lower, showing that the constituents of the ETF will open approximately  lower inJapan in the morning. In actuality, ETF INTL is trading  lower in theU.S. market at the same time. This probably would be showing up as a discount to IIV since it is based on the close of trading in Japan.This is a potential trading opportunity where you can buy the ETFdown  with the potential to sell the underlying basket in Japan down theexpected  on the open. There is a problem, however, in that if you just buythe ETF down  during the U.S. trading day, the pricing variables maychange between your purchase time and the time of the Japanese marketopen. During this span the perceived discount can be completely erased,leaving your portfolio at risk. You can attempt to lock in your arbitragespread by selling the group of stocks short to lock in the price differential,but this will leave you with an upanddown position. You are now longETF INTL and short the group of stocks. In theory, in this example, youare hedged and have locked in a spread. The only way to actually capturethat spread would be to unwind both sides simultaneously after the pricedifferential has narrowed. This is not pure arbitrage. It is quite differentfrom the arbitrage available in a domestic ETF trading at the same time asits basket. In this scenario, the ideal situation would be that the discountnarrows between your estimation of where the fund should be trading andwhere it actually is in the market. Then you would be able to sell ETF INTLin the market and buy back the group of stocks, closing out your positionsand locking in the spread differential. But since you are speculating on anovernight movement, you probably are holding the position for at least oneday. Also, in this simplified example, we are assuming that the correlatinghedge has an equal amount of offsetting foreign exchange exposure so asto isolate the bet on the equity piece. If the hedge is, for example, a groupof American companies and not American Depositary Receipts, you wouldP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies have to put on a yen currency trade to hedge out exposure inherent in theU.S.listed ETF with yen underlying constituents ETF INTL. This is thetype of trading going on in ETFs all the time. These international ETFstrade at a price that represents an estimation of a basket of stocks. Theyare trading independently from each other. The trading community hasmodels that it uses to estimate fair value eNAV at all times during thetrading day. Members are trading those ETFs versus their correlated hedgesbased on their eNAV estimations.You can interpolate the trading in the alternative ETF asset classes ofcommodities, currencies, and fixed income along the same lines. Sometimesthe basket and the underlying asset will be trading at the same time, andyou can enter into a more pure arbitragestyle trade. At other times theywill be trading separately, and you can trade spreads between the ETF andan estimation of the value of its underlying assets utilizing a proxy hedge.In all cases the CR mechanism can be used for establishing positions oneither side or for unwinding those same positions. But it cannot be used tocollapse your proxy hedge positions and free up your balance sheet becausethe vehicles being traded are not perfect replications of both the ETF andthe underlying basket. They are therefore not acceptable to the ETF issuervia the inkind CR process.Stock Loan Faci l i tat ionA type of arbitrage that utilizes the CR process but is not looking at discounts and premiums versus the underlying baskets is the financing trades.The main model in this arena is the facilitation of stock borrows. The stockloan market has been a good source of profits for the clearing firms providingstock borrows in ETFs. It is surprising that there is not a central clearinghouse with published rates and available quantities of stock that investorscan access and utilize as needed. The lack of a centralized system has created an opaque market where two investors can pay vastly different prices toborrow the same stock. This has led to a proliferation of financing arbitragetrades in the ETF arena between the funds and their underlying baskets. Ina trade where financing is the most important function, highspeed tradingcapabilities are rendered irrelevant.The most basic trade is to facilitate the borrow demand on an ETF bycreating shares to lend them out to the market. The procedure for this typeof facilitation would be to do what is known as a short creation. In a typicalcreation, the AP buys the basket of underlying stocks and delivers those to theissuer. In a short creation, instead of buying the underlying constituents, theAP would borrow the underlying basket shares and deliver those borrowedshares to the issuer. The AP would receive in turn newly issued shares ofP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONthe ETF. The process of delivering the shares of the underlying basket to theissuer creates a short position on the books of the AP, which is hedged bya long position created from the ETF issuance. The AP now has a marketneutral position. If the ETF rallies, creating a profit, the underlying basketshort will rally equally, creating an offsetting loss.This position, however, has an element of cost to finance it while onthe books. Exhibit . presents the various costs of maintaining a positionthat is long an ETF and short the underlying basket.The long cash rate is determined by the interest charged on money usedto buy the long asset, plus management fee depreciation, minus any benefitfrom the ability to loan out long positions. The short cash rate is calculatedby the interest rate received on cash raised from the asset sale minus the costof borrowing shares from the lender. The dividends are typically offsettingbecause the ETF is a passthrough vehicle any dividends owed on the shortside are also paid through to the ETF holder on the long side except in various international markets. Your intent is to receive more in loan fees thanyou are paying in the financing spread and management and borrow fees.Since this is not a trade done in the market, and you are perfectly hedged,the prices at which the ETF trades in the marketplace are irrelevant. If theETF happens to move to a premium in the market, you may be able tounwind your position at a price favorable to its initiation parity however,that is separate from successful operation of the stock loan facilitation.The typical method of entry to this type of trade would be through the CRprocess. It can also be entered, however, via the electronic trading of the ETFand the basket however, the costs of that type of entry can vary, dependingon the fund. If you plan to sell baskets and buy ETFs in large quantities andthere is no demand for lending the ETF, then it will be more expensive toposition the trade because the loan value of the long ETF shares will be lower.Additionally, it would be expensive for a market participant to do a creationEXHIB IT .

Every day there is a cost to maintainingthe position because of the expenses as accounted earlier. And there is theadditional expense of opportunity cost by tying up the balance sheet, whichhas become quite expensive as market participants seek optimization ofprofits resulting from decreased availability of leveraged capital.There are two ways to approach entry into this type of trade. Youcan seek out the demand from the stock loan markets and then do shortcreations to facilitate this demand. A difficulty with this method is that thereare a lot of market participants pursuing this same lowrisk strategy. Thesecond approach is more proactive, creating newer ETFs to spark demand.This involves taking calculated risks that there is short interest waiting forshares to become available for borrowing. Your reward for those calculatedrisks will be a higher spread in a less crowded trade, enabling the loanof a higher percentage of your shares. Since much of the borrow marketis based on overnight availability, this type of trading requires frequentmonitoring and positioning of trades. Because of the CR features of theETFs, the demand market for ETFs can change dramatically very quickly.But as market participants are using ETFs for longerterm long investments,they are adding some stability to the loan markets because they are able toprovide borrows for long time frames at stable rates.The swap market is also able to lock in financing rates for set timeperiods and helps to stabilize overnight fluctuations in interest rates thatthreaten to change the costs of positions and hedges. If you can matchup the durations on both sides of the trade, you can add stability away fromthe overnightstyle market of the stock loan arena.Facilitating ETF borrows has been a great profit engine for clearingbusinesses. If you are able to successfully track any changes in the basket,you will have negligible market risk. When the position becomes crowdedand no longer profitable, you can easily unwind by using the redemptionprocess. Because the ETF market publishes daily baskets, tracking is a verymanageable risk, and daily CR eliminates potential longterm exposures.At the point of unwind, you can deliver your ETF shares to the issuer it willdeliver you shares of the basket, which you can then use to close out yourborrowed positions. ETFs are a great tool for shorting to hedge risk or offsetother long exposures. The resultant demand to borrow ETFs is satisfied viathe CR mechanism and a firm willing to house that position on its balancesheet.Stat ist ica l Arbitrage and HighFrequency TradingETF quotes seem to change at a far more rapid pace than do quotes forequities. This is understandable when you look at the calculation of the IIVP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to Come ETF TRADING AND EXECUTIONEXHIB IT .

When there is anychange in the valuation of any of the underlying components, the impliedvalue of an ETF changes. The change can be small and almost imperceptiblebut could potentially create an opportunity for trading and would require achange in your market. Exhibit . shows a very basic demonstration ofhow a change in the basket can change the valuation of the ETF.P ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies Exhibit . depicts a very simple ETF with four component stocks. Ittakes , shares of each stock to create one unit of the ETF that equals, shares. You can see the current bid, ask, and last prices for eachstock in the basket. Then, below those, is the implied ETF IIV from thebasket. Scenario  depicts the ETF and its components in the first momentof monitoring the basket. In scenario , the bid price of stock  has changed,and this has caused an increase in the bid side valuation of the ETF IIV bothare shaded in gray. Because of this bidside move in the component, the ETFbuyer should, in theory, be willing to pay a higher price for the ETF. Anarbitrage firm watching that valuation would believe that it can sell thebasket for a slightly higher price than a moment ago scenario  and wouldbe willing to pay a slightly higher price as well. While I do not show themarket prices of the ETF, they would presumably move, in this case, becausethe valuation they are based on has changed. In scenario , the last priceof stock  has changed. I am using last price to indicate trade price, so achange in the last price indicates that stock  has just traded at a higher pricethan it had a moment ago. The last price of the ETF IIV number is showingyou the last trading price of the basket of securities underlying the ETF.While the bid and ask will show you the value that you can potentially tradeat any given time, the lastprice IIV is always a slightly backwardlookingnumber in that it indicates the most recently known activity. All of thesenumbers will be used in the formation of algorithms for electronic trading.TRADING TIPA change in the lastprice valuation of the ETF will cause a revaluationof expectations for where the ETF will trade next. To be clear, theETF did not actually trade at that price the basket underlying the ETFdid. Since the two vehicles are completely fungible, and the ETF is aderivative of the basket, you can interpret that as an ETF trade.If it was a baskettrading algorithm and it bought , shares of allfour stocks in the basket at the last price in scenario  . and then sold, shares of the ETF simultaneously at ., it would have lockedin a . gross gain on the trade. The size of this trade is not restricted tocreation unit CU size. If the algorithm was able to buy only , sharesof each stock, then it would sell only , shares of the ETF.

It would make sense to assume than an algorithm will continuetrading until the opportunity for profit has disappeared.To do a basic backoftheenvelope calculation on the amount of arbitrage opportunities potentially occurring every moment, lets look at thenumber of ETFs available. Lets say there are  U.S.listed ETFs withan average of  components in each. If you are monitoring the bid, ask,and last prices of every component for all the ETFs, you are monitoringalmost , quotes per moment. This does not even include monitoringprice changes in the actual ETF market. The true numbers are most assuredlymuch larger! I use the term moment in this discussion because the conceptof the length of time in that moment is decreasing almost constantly. Thetrading and calculation times for the statistical arbitrage trading businessare down to milliseconds, or thousandths of a second. Timing and financingdifferences based on calculations similar to those described are what is driving the increases in volume in certain ETFs. And there is the set of decisioncalculations that is determining the probabilities of getting executions beforeother competing machines.Some argue against growth in highfrequency trading businesses as adetriment to ordinary investors. I have, however, not seen a compelling orstatistically documented argument persuading me that that is the case. Foran ordinary investor, whose typical size is very small, the highfrequency systems have narrowed spreads on many trading vehicles. They have also pursued efficiency between multiple products, driving away costly inefficiencies.In the diverse world of ETF trading, I consider the electronic tradingbusinesses to be acting in a beneficial manner. They are responsible fornarrowing the spreads between ETFs and their underlying baskets, andthey are providing liquidity to the investment community. When you movebeyond the most liquid ETFs, as I describe earlier in the book, a typicaltransaction takes place between a customer and a liquidity provider. As wehave learned from several sections in this book, LPs are typically providingliquidity based on some arbitrage strategy, between the ETF and the basket,in some underlying derivative, or in some other correlating hedge vehicle. Ifthese LPs were not pursuing these strategies, then ETF pricing would dependon matching natural customer buyers and sellers and would be less relatedto the price of the underlying basket. This would lead to less volume andwider spread in the products.CONCLUSIONThe trading community is both benefiting from and driving the growthof the ETF industry. There is high demand for traders and salespeopleP ab P cd QC ef T gc JWBTAbner January ,   Printer Yet to ComeMarket Participants and Their Trading Strategies experienced in analyzing and trading exchangelisted products of all types.Even during the recent consolidation and repositioning of the major trading firms, there has been consistent positioning of market participants inthe ETF space. Much of this is driven by the continued growth of the customer base adopting the ETF structure. The increase in volumes of ETFs hasbeen good for both investors and industry professionals. Disconnecting theexecution mechanism from the portfolio and asset management aspect ofan investment vehicle will lead to increased efficiencies for investors in thefuture.New avenues for investing, whether they are previously unavailableexposures or new strategies for outperforming a benchmark, are expandingthe dialogue on how best to invest. Many in the industry are focusing onthe looming battle between ETFs and mutual funds for trillions of dollarsof actively managed assets. They realize the potential growth impact thiscan have on the ETF trading and investing communities. Both systems andpeople will have to continue to advance and evolve to satisfy the comingexplosion in liquidity demands as trading shifts from portfolio managers andtraders at mutual funds firms to trading desks of ETF liquidity providers.The true consequences of the growth in the ETF marketplace will notbe fully understood for many years.
